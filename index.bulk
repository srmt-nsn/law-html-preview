{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 1.01.020 Purpose This chapter will replace the \"Act relating to Tribal Council Powers, Procedures, Initiative Referendum, Recall and Removal from Office\" commonly referred to as the 1994 Procedures Act. This chapter significantly revises the 1994 Procedures Act by giving enrolled Tribal Members (hereafter referred to as Members) a greater voice in Tribal Government and making the Tribal Government more transparent and accountable to Members. The Ordinance allows more Member participation in the Tribal Government, makes it much less burdensome for Members to initiate petitions to enact laws, reject laws and place questions before the membership in a referendum process. The Ordinance also makes the Tribal Council's (hereafter referred to as Council) actions more transparent and open by requiring the Council to conduct its business through regular meetings open to the membership. In addition, the Ordinance establishes rules or conduct and procedures for Tribal Monthly Meetings, provides for a process allowing Members to review Tribal budgets and also allows Members access to public Tribal records.

The purpose of these informal Rules of Evidence is to ensure that the Tribal Court is able to determine the truth of a matter with a minimum of delay, confusion, and uncertainty of the parties. (b) General Rules. (1) Where there is more than one kind of evidence about the same subject, the judge shall give each item of evidence the importance (weight) which, according the judge's common sense and sense of fairness, that particular type of evidence deserves. For example, in oral testimony, the testimony of persons who testify from their personal knowledge, such as first-hand observation of, or participation in, the event described shall be given more weight than the testimony of persons who only have knowledge of the event that they gained from other persons. (2) Evidence admitted in the Tribal Court must be related either to the issues before the court or to the weight and credibility which should be given to other evidence. When questioned by the judge or another party as to why certain evidence should be allowed, the party who wishes to present the evidence shall: (A) State the issue which he or she will use the evidence to resolve; and (B) Explain how the evidence is relevant to the issue. (C) When the relevance or reliability of evidence is challenged, the judge shall decide whether or not to use the evidence, and explain the decision. (c) Oaths. Prior to testifying before the Tribal Court, every witness shall first state before the judge, parties and spectators that he or she will testify truthfully. The Court may prescribe an oath for this purpose by the Rules of the Court. (d) Questioning Witnesses. (1) When questioning a witness, the judge and parties or their counsel shall not ask questions in such a way as to suggest the answer, unless the witness is one who was called by the opposing party, or is clearly hostile to the person asking questions.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 5.02.010 Purpose, Authority, Applicability And Implementation The Tribal Council of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, a federally - recognized Tribe of Indians, hereby enacts the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Water Quality Standards. (a) Purpose . The purpose of the Tribe's Water Quality Standards is as follows: (1) Assign designated uses for which Tribal Surface Waters shall be protected; (2) Prescribe and impose water quality standards (narrative and numeric) in order to sustain the designated use of Tribal Surface Waters; (3) Protect against the degradation of Tribal Surface Waters; (4) Promote the social welfare and economic well-being of the Tribe; (5) Promote a holistic watershed approach to management of the Tribal Surface Waters; (6) Provide for the protection of threatened or endangered species and, (7) Protect cultural and ceremonial uses. The purpose of these water quality standards is to facilitate sovereign self-determination and the restoration and preservation of traditional hunting, fishing, gathering and cultural uses in, on and around Tribal Surface Waters. The Environment Division is committed to providing cleaner, safer water for all of creation. These water quality standards will in turn promote the general welfare and well-being of the community by allowing the Tribe and its members to utilize the water for traditional, cultural and ceremonial purposes. Water quality standards are not used to control, and are not invalidated by, natural background phenomena or acts of the Creator. These purposes shall be accomplished by utilizing the standards set forth in the Tribe's Water Quality Standards as the basis for permitting and management process for point source discharges and nonpoint source generators, by using treatment technologies to control point sources and by adopting best management practices for nonpoint sources of pollution. (b) Authority . The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe maintains the plenary sovereign power to regulate the quality of Tribal Surface Waters in the interest of the health and wellbeing of the Mohawk People. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7303 and 518 of the Clean Water Act the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved the Tribe's Application for a Determination of Eligibility to Administer Programs under the Clean Water Act on October 16, 2002. (c) Applicability . The Tribal Water Quality Standards apply to all Tribal Surface Waters, that is, all surface waters within the exterior boundaries of the Saint Regis Mohawk Territory, including water situated wholly or partly within, or bordering upon, the Territory, whether public or private, except for private waters that do not combine with other surface waters. (d) Implementation . (1) Water Resources Personnel. The Water Resources Program shall administer the SRMT WQS. The program is comprised of a Program Manager and Technicians. This program shall serve under the direction of the Director of the SRMT Environment Division. (2) Consistency. The Tribe's Water Quality Standards are consistent with section 101(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251(a)(2)), which declares that \"it is the national goal that, wherever attainable, an interim goal of water quality which provides for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and provides for recreation in and on the water achieved by July, 1983....\" Primary contact and ceremonial use, agricultural and water supply use are other designated uses of Tribal Surface Waters. The Tribe's Water Quality Standards provide that such designated uses shall not result in any contamination that may lower the quality of the water below what is required for recreation and protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife. (3) Antidegradation Policy. The antidegradation policy for Tribal Surface Waters and the procedures for implementing it are set forth in Section 5.02.030 and in the Implementation Plan. (4) Revisions. The Tribal Water Quality Standards will be reviewed every 3 years. The review provides an opportunity for revisions and/or additions based on new information or for clarification of existing issues. (5) Public hearings. Following enactment, pursuant to Section 303(c)(1) of the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. Section 303(c)], the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe shall hold public hearings at least once every three years for the purpose of reviewing and, as appropriate, amending the Tribal Water Quality Standards. Findings and revisions shall incorporate relevant scientific and engineering advances as well as any other relevant environmental concerns. (6) Protection of Designated Uses. Conditions particular to a use shall be protected at all times. General Conditions ( Section 5.02.040 , below) shall be maintained at all times and shall apply to all Tribal Surface Waters, whether perennial, ephemeral, or intermittent. The standards assigned to each Tribal Surface Water shall be the most stringent standards required to protect all uses designated for that body of water. (7) Use Attainability. In the event that monitoring of water quality identifies reaches where attainable water quality is less than what is required by the Tribal Water Quality Standards, then the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe may modify the Water Quality Standards to reflect attainability. Modification shall then be within the sole discretion of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, but shall be subject to the provisions of the Clean Water Act, and shall be carried out in accordance with use-attainability analysis procedures required by 40 CFR 131.10. A designated use, that is not an existing use, may be removed if it is demonstrated that attaining the designated use is infeasible. Further, at a minimum, uses are considered attainable if they can be achieved by implementing effluent limits required under Sections 301(b) and 306 of the Clean Water Act (Act) and by implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management practices (BMPs) for nonpoint source control. (40 CFR 131.10(h)(2)). If the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe adopts a new or revised water quality standard based on a required use attainability analysis, the Tribe shall also adopt the highest attainable use, as defined in \u00a7131.3(m). A Use Attainability Analysis must be conducted whenever: (1) The Tribe designates or has designated uses that do not include the uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act, or (2) The Tribe wishes to remove a designated use that is specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act or to adopt subcategories of uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act which require less stringent criteria. The regulation (at 40 CFR 131.10(g)) specifies that States and Tribes may remove a designated use which is not an existing use if attainment of a use is not feasible due to the following: (A) Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the attainment of a use; or, (B) Natural, ephemeral, intermittent, or low flow conditions or water levels prevent the attainment of the use, unless these conditions may be compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent discharges without violating State or Tribal water conservation requirements to enable uses to be met; or, (C) Human caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the attainment of the use and cannot be remedied or would cause more environmental damage to correct than to leave in place; or; (D) Dams, diversions or other types of hydrological modifications preclude the attainment of the use, and it is not feasible to restore the water body to its original condition or operate such modification in a way that would result in the attainment of a use; or, (E) Physical conditions related to the natural features of the water body, such as the lack of a proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the like, unrelated to water quality, preclude attainment of aquatic life protection uses; or, f. Controls more stringent than those required by Sections 301(b) and 306 of the Act would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact. ( Res. No. 2022-04 ; Res. No. 2020-02 ; Res.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 5.02.030 Antidegradation Policy And Implementation Procedures, Mixing Zones, And Allowance For Compliance Schedules (a) Antidegradation Policy: This antidegradation standard shall be applicable to any action or activity by any source, point or nonpoint, of pollutants that is anticipated to result in an increased loading of pollutants to Tribal surface waters. Pursuant to this standard: (1) Existing instream water uses, as defined herein, and the level of water quality necessary to protect existing uses shall be maintained and protected. Where designated uses of the water body are impaired, there shall be no lowering of the water quality with respect to the pollutant or pollutants which are causing the impairment; (2) Where, for any parameter, the quality of the waters exceed levels necessary to support the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the waters, that water shall be considered high quality for that parameter consistent with the definition of high quality water found at subsection of this antidegradation standard and that quality shall be maintained and protected unless the Tribe finds, after full satisfaction of Tribe's intergovernmental coordination and public participation provisions of the Tribe's continuing planning process, that allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation, the Tribe shall assure water quality adequate to fully protect existing uses. Further, the Tribe shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and existing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. The Tribe shall utilize the Antidegradation Implementation Procedures set forth below in determining if any lowering of water quality will be allowed; (A) The Tribe identifies waters for the protections described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section on a parameter-by-parameter basis. (B) Before allowing any lowering of high water quality, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Tribe shall find, after an analysis of alternatives, that such a lowering is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the area in which the waters are located. The analysis of alternatives shall evaluate a range of practicable alternatives that would prevent or lessen the degradation associated with the proposed activity. When the analysis of alternatives identifies one or more practicable alternatives, the Tribe shall only find that a lowering is necessary if one such alternative is selected for implementation. (3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding national or tribal resource, such as waters of national and State parks and wildlife refuges and waters of exceptional recreational, religious or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected; and (4) In those cases where the potential lowering of water quality is associated with a thermal discharge, the decision to allow such degradation shall be consistent with Section 316 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). (A) As described in Section B. below, the Tribe has developed methods for implementing the antidegradation policy that are, at a minimum, consistent with the Tribe's policy and with paragraph (a) of this section. The Tribe shall provide an opportunity for public involvement during the development and any subsequent revisions of the implementation methods, and shall make the methods available to the public. (b) Antidegradation Implementation Procedures: (1) Definitions. (A) Control Document. Any authorization issued by a State, Tribal or Federal agency to any source of pollutants to waters under its jurisdiction that specifies conditions under which the source is allowed to operate. (B) High quality waters. High quality waters are water bodies in which, on a parameter by parameter basis, the quality of the waters exceeds levels necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water. (C) Outstanding Resource Waters. Those waters designated as such by the Tribe. The Waters that may be considered for designation as Outstanding Resource Waters include, but are not limited to, water bodies that are recognized as: (i) Important because of protection through official action, such as Tribal, Federal or State law, Presidential or secretarial action, international treaty, or interstate compact; (ii) Having exceptional recreational significance; (iii) Having exceptional ecological significance; (iv) Having other special environmental, recreational, religious or ecological attributes; or waters whose designation as Outstanding Resource Waters is reasonably necessary for the protection of other waters so designated. (D) Significant Lowering of Water Quality. A significant lowering of water quality occurs when there is a new or increased loading of any Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics (PBT) from any regulated existing or new facility, either point source or nonpoint source for which there is a control document or reviewable action, as a result of any activity including, but not limited to: (i) Construction of a new regulated facility or modification of an existing regulated facility such that a new or modified control document is required; (ii) Modification of an existing regulated facility operating under a current control document such that the production capacity of the facility is increased; (iii) Addition of a new source of untreated or pretreated effluent containing or expected to contain any PBT to an existing wastewater treatment works, whether public or private; (iv) A request for an increased limit in an applicable control document; (v) Other deliberate activities that, based on the information available, could be reasonably expected to result in an increased loading of any pollutant to Tribal surface waters. (2) Notwithstanding the above, changes in loadings of any Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxic within the existing capacity and processes, and that are covered by the existing applicable control document, are not subject to an antidegradation review. These changes include, but are not limited to: (A) Normal operational variability; (B) Changes in intake water pollutants; (C) Increasing the production hours of the facility, (e.g., adding a second shift); or (D) Increasing the rate of production. (3) Also, excluded from an antidegradation review are new effluent limits based on improved monitoring data or new water quality criteria or values that are not a result of changes in pollutant loading. (4) For all waters, the Environment Division shall ensure that the level of water quality necessary to protect existing uses is maintained. In order to achieve this requirement, water quality standards use designations must include all existing uses. Controls shall be established as necessary on point and nonpoint sources of pollutants to ensure that the criteria applicable to the designated use are achieved in the water and that any designated use of a downstream water is protected. Where water quality does not support the designated uses of a water body or ambient pollutant concentrations exceed water quality criteria applicable to that water body, the Environment Division shall not allow a lowering of water quality for the pollutant or pollutants preventing the attainment of such uses or exceeding such criteria. (5) For Outstanding Resource Waters: (A) The Environment Division shall ensure, through the application of appropriate controls on pollutant sources, that water quality is maintained and protected. (B) Exception. A short-term, temporary (i.e., weeks or months) lowering of water quality may be permitted by the Environment Division (or US EPA where SRMT is the permittee). (C) For Natural State, high quality waters, the Environment Division shall ensure that no action resulting in a lowering of water quality occurs unless an antidegradation demonstration has been completed pursuant to Section C and the information thus provided is determined by the Environment Division pursuant to Section B of this Antidegradation Standard to adequately support the lowering of water quality. (6) The Environment Division or EPA shall establish conditions in the control document applicable to the regulated facility that prohibit the regulated facility from undertaking any deliberate action, such that there would be an increase in the rate of mass loading of any pollutant, unless an antidegradation demonstration is provided to the Environment Division and approved pursuant to Section D prior to commencement of the action. Imposition of limits due to improved monitoring data or new water quality criteria or values, or changes in loadings of any pollutant within the existing capacity and processes, and that are covered by the existing applicable control document, are not subject to an antidegradation review. (7) For PBTs known or believed to be present in a discharge, from a point or nonpoint source, a monitoring requirement shall be included in the control document. The control document shall also include a provision requiring the source to notify the Environment Division of any increased loadings. Upon notification, the Environment Division shall require actions as necessary to reduce or eliminate the increased loading. (8) Fact Sheets prepared for public review and comment shall reflect any conditions developed under this Antidegradation Standard and included in a permit. (9) Exemptions. Except as the Environment Division may determine on a case- by-case basis that the application of these procedures is required to adequately protect water quality, or as the affected water body is an Outstanding Resource Water as defined in Section B of this Antidegradation Standard, the procedures in this part do not apply to: (A) Short-term, temporary (i.e., weeks or months) lowering of water quality; (B) Bypasses that are not prohibited at 40 CFR 122.41(m); and (C) Response actions pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended, or similar Federal, State or Tribal authorities, undertaken to alleviate a release into the environment of hazardous substances or pollutants which may pose an imminent and substantial danger to public health or welfare. (c) Antidegradation Demonstration: Any entity seeking to lower water quality in a High Quality Water must first, as required by Section B of this Antidegradation Standard, submit an antidegradation demonstration for consideration by the Environment Division. The antidegradation demonstration shall include the following: (1) Pollution Prevention Alternatives Analysis. Identify any cost-effective pollution prevention alternatives and techniques that are available to the entity, that would eliminate or significantly reduce the extent to which the increased loading results in a lowering of water quality. (2) Alternative or Enhanced Treatment Analysis. Identify alternative or enhanced treatment techniques that are available to the entity that would eliminate the lowering of water quality and their costs relative to the cost of treatment necessary to achieve applicable effluent limitations. (3) Important Social or Economic Development Analysis. Identify the social or economic development and the benefits to the area in which the waters are located that will be foregone if the lowering of water quality is not allowed. (4) Special Provision for Remedial Actions. Entities proposing remedial actions pursuant to the CERCLA, as amended, corrective actions pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or similar actions pursuant to other Federal, State or Tribal environmental statutes may submit information to the Environment Division that demonstrates that the action utilizes the most cost effective pollution prevention and treatment techniques available, and minimizes the necessary lowering of water quality, in lieu of the information required by Section B of this Antidegradation Standard. (d) Antidegradation Decision: Once the Environment Division determines that the information provided by the entity proposing to increase loadings is administratively complete, the Environment Division shall use that information to determine whether or not the lowering of water quality is necessary, and, if it is necessary, whether or not the lowering of water quality will support important social and economic development in the area. If the proposed lowering of water quality is either not necessary, or will not support important social and economic development, the Environment Division shall deny the request to lower water quality. If the lowering of water quality is necessary, and will support important social and economic development, the Environment Division may allow all or part of the proposed lowering to occur as necessary to accommodate important social and economic development. (e) Mixing Zones: (1) Where effluent is discharged into surface waters, a continuous zone shall be maintained in which the water is of adequate quality to allow the migration of aquatic life with no significant effect on their population. The cross-sectional zone area of wastewater mixing zones shall generally be less than 1/4 of the cross-sectional area or flow volume of the receiving river, stream or lake. Unmixed zones containing permitted effluent shall not be at locations of recreational or ceremonial use. (See Section V, below.) Water quality standards shall be maintained throughout Zones of Passage. Zones of passage in intermittent streams may be designated on a site specific basis. The water quality in a Zone of Passage shall not fall below standards for the designated water body(ies) within which the zone is contained. (2) Mixing zones will not be granted for discharges to outstanding resource water, wetlands, or ephemeral or intermittent streams. (3) Mixing zones will not be granted for Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics (PBT) consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 132. See appendix 1. Waste Load Applications (WLAs) in the absence of TMDLs, and WLAs for the purposes of determining the need for water quality based effluent limits (WQBELs) for new discharges of PBTs shall be set equal to the most stringent applicable criteria or values for the PBTs in question. (4) Mixing zones shall not be used for, or considered as, a substitute for waste treatment. (f) Allowance for Compliance Schedules NPDES permits, and other orders and directives of the Division issued under Tribal Council, for existing discharges or activities may include a schedule for achieving compliance with water quality criteria contained herein, consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR Parts 131.15 and 132. These compliance schedules shall be developed to ensure compliance with the water quality standards set forth in the shortest practicable time period, not to exceed five years. Decisions regarding whether to issue compliance schedules will be done on a case-by-case basis by the Tribal Council and approved by the Division, or the EPA where appropriate. These schedules will not be issued for new discharges or activities. (g) Water Quality Standards Variances It is the SRMT's policy that a water quality standards variance is only appropriate when a designated use is not attainable in the short-term but might be attainable in the long-term. The SRMT may consider a temporary modification to a designated use and associated water quality criteria that would otherwise apply. (1) Applicability: A variance from any WQS that is the basis of a water quality-based effluent limitation included in a Permit is based on the following: (A) A variance from WQS applies only to the permittee requesting the WQS variance, the water body/waterbody segment(s) specified in the WQS variance and only to the pollutant or pollutants specified in the WQS variance. (B) A WQS variance does not affect, or require the SRMT to modify, in its standards, the underlying designated use and criterion address by the WQS variance, unless the SRMT adopts and EPA approves a revision to the underlying designated use and criterion consistent with \u00a7131.10 and \u00a7131.11. All other applicable standards not specifically addressed by the WQS variance remain applicable. (C) A variance does not affect, or require SRMT to modify, the corresponding water quality standard for the waterbody as a whole. (D) A WQS variance, once adopted by the SRMT and approved by EPA, shall be the applicable standard for purposes of the CWA under 40 CFR 131.21(d)-(e), for the following limited purposes. An approved WQS variance applies for the purposes of developing permit limits and requirements under 301(b)(1)(C), where appropriate, consistent with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The SRMT and other certifying entities may also use an approved WQS variance when issuing certifications under section 401 of the CWA. (E) A variance from a water quality standard shall not be granted that would likely jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species listed under Section 4 of the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) Act or result in the destruction or adverse modification of such species' critical habitat. (F) A variance from WQS shall not be granted if standards will be attained by implementing effluent limits required under sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA and by the permittee implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. (2) The maximum timeframe: A variance from the WQS shall not exceed five (5) years or the term of the permit, whichever is less. The SRMT will review, and modify as necessary, variances from WQS as part of each water quality standards review pursuant to section 303(c) of the CWA. (3) Conditions to grant: A variance from the WQS may be granted if, and only if: (A) The permittee demonstrates to the SRMT that attaining the WQS is not feasible because: (i) Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the attainment of the WQS; (ii) Natural, ephemeral, intermittent or low flow conditions or water levels prevent the attainment of the WQS, unless these conditions may be compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent to enable WQS to be met without violating the SRMT's water conservation requirements; (iii) Human-caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the attainment of the WQS and cannot be remedied, or would cause more environmental damage to correct than to leave in place; (iv) Dams, diversions or other types of hydrologic modifications preclude the attainment of the WQS, and it is not feasible to restore the waterbody to its original condition or to operate such modification in a way that would result in the attainment of the WQS; (v) Physical conditions related to the natural features of the waterbody, such as the lack of a proper substrate cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the like, unrelated to chemical water quality, preclude attainment of WQS; or (vi) Controls more stringent than those required by sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact. (B) The permittee shall also: (i) Show that the WQS variance requested conforms to the requirements of the antidegradation procedures in Section III.A; and (ii) Characterize the extent of any increased risk to human health and the environment associated with granting the WQS variance compared with compliance with WQS absent the variance, such that the SRMT is able to conclude that any such increased risk is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. (4) Requirements for Submission of Application to the SRMT: (A) An application for a WQS variance must include: (i) Identification of the pollutant(s) or water quality parameter(s), and the water body/waterbody segment(s) to which the WQS variance applies. Discharger(s)-specific WQS variances must also identify the permittee(s) subject to the WQS variance. (ii) The requirements that apply throughout the term of the WQS variance. The requirements shall represent the highest attainable condition of the water body or waterbody segment applicable throughout the term of the WQS variance based on the documentation required in (d)(2) of this section. The requirements shall not result in any lowering of the currently attained ambient water quality, unless a WQS variance is necessary for restoration activities, consistent with paragraph (d)(2)(A)(i)(b) of this section. DPNR must specify the highest attainable condition of the water body or waterbody segment as a quantifiable expression that is one of the following: (I) For discharger(s)-specific WQS variances: (a) The highest attainable interim criterion, or (b) The interim effluent condition that reflects the greatest pollutant reduction achievable, or (c) If no additional feasible pollutant control technology can be identified, the interim criterion or interim effluent condition that reflects the greatest pollutant reduction achievable with the pollutant control technologies installed at the time the Territory adopts the WQS variance, and the adoption and implementation of a Pollutant Minimization Program. (II) For WQS variances applicable to a water body or waterbody segment: (a) The highest attainable interim use and interim criterion, or (b) If no additional feasible pollutant control technology can be identified, the interim use and interim criterion that reflects the greatest pollutant reduction achievable with the pollutant control technologies installed at the time the Territory adopts the WQS variance, and the adoption and implementation of a Pollutant Minimization Program. (iii) A statement providing that the requirements of the WQS variance are either the highest attainable condition identified at the time of the adoption of the WQS variance. (iv) The term of the WQS variance, expressed as an interval of time from the date of the SRMT approval or a specific date. The term of the WQS variance must only be as long as necessary to achieve the highest attainable condition and consistent with the demonstration provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The SRMT may adopt a subsequent WQS variance consistent with this section. (B) The supporting documentation must include: (i) Documentation demonstrating the need for a WQS variance. (I) For a WQS variance to a use specified in section 101(a)(2) of the CWA or a sub-category of such a use, the SRMT must demonstrate that attaining the designated use and criterion is not feasible throughout the term of the WQS variance because: (a) All relevant information demonstrating that attaining the WQS is not feasible based on one or more of the conditions in \u00a7186-14 (c)(1) herein; or (b) Actions necessary to facilitate lake, wetland, or stream restoration through dam removal or other significant reconfiguration activities preclude attainment of the designated use and criterion while the actions are being implemented. (II) For a WQS variance to a non-101(a)(2) use, the SRMT must submit documentation justifying how its consideration of the use and value of the water for those uses listed in \u00a7 131.10(a) appropriately supports the WQS variance and term. A demonstration consistent with (d)(2)(A)(i) of this section may be used to satisfy this requirement. (ii) Documentation demonstrating that the term of the WQS variance is only as long as necessary to achieve the highest attainable condition. Such documentation must justify the term of the WQS variance by describing the pollutant control activities to achieve the highest attainable condition, including those activities identified through a Pollutant Minimization Program, which serve as milestones for the WQS variance. (iii) In addition to (A) and (B) of this section, for a WQS variance that applies to a water body or waterbody segment: (I) Identification and documentation of any cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source controls related to the pollutant(s) or water quality parameter(s) and water body or waterbody segment(s) specified in the WQS variance that could be implemented to make progress towards attaining the underlying designated use and criterion. DPNR must provide public notice and comment for any such documentation. (II) Any subsequent WQS variance for a water body or waterbody segment must include documentation of whether and to what extent best management practices for nonpoint source controls were implemented to address the pollutant(s) or water quality parameter(s) subject to the WQS variance and the water quality progress achieved. (iv) All relevant information demonstrating compliance with the conditions in (c)(2) herein. (5) Implementing WQS variances in NPDES permits: A WQS variance serves as the applicable water quality standard for implementing permitting requirements pursuant to 40 CFR \u00a7 122.44(d) for the term of the WQS variance. Any limitations and requirements necessary to implement the WQS variance shall be included as enforceable conditions of the permit for the permittee(s) subject to the WQS variance. (6) Public notice of preliminary decision: Upon receipt of a complete application for a variance from the WQS, and upon making a preliminary decision regarding the WQS variance, the SRMT shall public notice the request and preliminary decision for public comment. This public notice will be satisfied by including the supporting information for the variance from the WQS and the preliminary decision in the public notice of a draft TPDES permit. (7) Final decision: The SRMT will issue a final decision on a WQS variance request within 90 days of the expiration of the public comment period required in accordance with the permit. If the SRMT approves all or part of the variance from the WQS, the decision shall include all permit conditions needed to implement those parts of the WQS variance as approved. Such permit conditions shall, at a minimum, require: (A) Compliance with an initial effluent limitation which, at the time the variance from the WQS is granted, represents the level currently achievable by the permittee, and which is no less stringent than that achieved under the previous permit; (B) Achieving reasonable progress toward attaining the water quality standards for the waterbody as a whole through appropriate conditions; (C) When the duration of a variance from the WQS is shorter than the duration of a permit, compliance with an effluent limitation sufficient to meet the underlying water quality standard, upon the expiration of said WQS variance; and (D) A provision that allows the SRMT to reopen and modify or revoke any condition granted in a WQS variance due to the permittee not providing relevant information that reasonable would affect the decision process. (8) Incorporating the WQS variance: The SRMT will establish and incorporate into the permittee's permit all conditions needed to implement the variance from the WQS as determined in (g) herein.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 5.02.040 General Conditions (a) General Conditions The following conditions shall apply to the water quality criteria and classifications set forth herein. (1) All Tribal Surface Waters shall be free from pollutants in concentrations or combinations that do not protect the most sensitive use of the water body, except as provided under mixing zones. (2) Whenever the natural conditions of surface water of the Tribe are of a lower quality than the aquatic life criteria assigned, the Division may determine that the natural conditions shall constitute the aquatic life water quality criteria. If a natural condition varies with time, the natural condition will be determined as the highest quality prevailing natural condition measured during an annual, seasonal, or shorter time period prior to influence of human-caused pollution. The Division may, at its discretion, determine a natural condition for one or more seasonal or shorter time period(s) to reflect variable ambient conditions. (3) All waters shall attain and maintain a level of water quality that provides for the attainment and maintenance of the water quality standards of downstream waters. At the boundary between waters of different classifications, the water quality standards that are more stringent will prevail. When a distinction cannot be made between surface water, wetlands, groundwater, or sediments, then the applicable standards shall depend upon which existing or designated use is, or could be, adversely affected. If the uses of more than one resource are affected, than the most protective criteria shall apply. (4) The Division may revise criteria on a territory-wide or water body-specific basis as needed to protect aquatic life and human health and other existing and designated uses, and also to increase the technical accuracy of the criteria being applied. The Division shall formally adopt any revised criteria following public review and comment. (b) General Narrative and Numeric Criteria The following Narrative Criteria apply to all Tribal Surface Waters of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, including intermittent streams and within designated mixing zones. (1) Suspended, colloidal and settleable solids: Tribal surface waters shall be free from suspended, colloidal and settleable solids that will cause deposition or impair the waters for their designated uses. (2) Oil, grease and any floating substances: Tribal Surface Waters shall be free from oil and grease, including visible oil film and globules of oil. (3) Color: Tribal Surface Waters shall be free from substances that will adversely affect the color or impair the water of their designated uses. Color-producing substances from other than natural sources are limited to concentrations equivalent to 15 color units (CU). (4) Odor and Taste: Tribal Surface Waters shall be free from substances that will adversely affect the taste, odor thereof, or impair the water of their designated uses. (5) Nitrogen and Phosphorus: Tribal Surface Waters shall be free from nutrients in concentrations that will result in growths of algae, weeds and slimes that will impair their designated uses. (6) Pathogens: Designated Uses of Tribal Surface Waters shall not be impaired by pathogens, as measured by Pathogen Indicator Bacteria, pursuant to SRMT swimming and bathing criteria in Section VI(A). (7) Turbidity: Turbidity attributable to other than natural causes, shall not reduce light transmission to a point that causes an unaesthetic and substantial visible contrast with the natural appearance of the water. (8) Temperature Thermal discharge: The introduction of heat by other than natural causes shall not increase the temperature in a stream, outside a mixing zone, by more than 2.7\u00b0C (5\u00b0F), based upon the monthly average of the maximum daily temperatures measured at mid-depth or three feet (whichever is less) outside the mixing zone. The normal daily and seasonal variations that were present before the addition of heat from other than natural sources shall be maintained. In no case shall man-introduced heat be permitted when the maximum temperature specified for the reach (20\u00b0C/68\u00b0F for cold water fisheries and 32.2\u00b0C/90\u00b0F for warm water fisheries) would thereby be exceeded. (A) Exclusions. Privately owned ponds that do not combine with other Tribal Surface Waters are exempt from this thermal discharge standard. However, waters released from any such pond into a stream or river must meet Tribal Water Quality Standards of the receiving water body. (9) Salinity/Mineral Quality (total dissolved solids, chlorides, and sulfates): Existing mineral quality shall not be altered by municipal, industrial, and instream activities, or other waste discharges so as to interfere with the designated uses for a water body. An increase of more than 1/3 over naturally-occurring levels shall not be permitted. In no case shall dischargers cause concentrations in rivers with a domestic water supply use to exceed 250 mg/l of chlorides, 250 mg/l sulfates and 500 mg/l total dissolved solids. (10) pH: The pH of Tribal Surface Waters shall not be permitted to fluctuate in excess of 1.0 unit over a period of 24 hours for other than natural causes or outside the range 6.5-8.5 (11) Garbage, cinders, ashes, sludge, concrete wash and other refuse: Tribal Surface waters shall be free of these items in any amount. (12) Dissolved Oxygen: The DO standard for the protection of aquatic life in surface waters shall not be less than a daily average of 6.0 mg/l, and at no time less than 5.0. For water bodies used as spawning habitat by cold water fishes (e.g. salmonids) the DO standard shall be no less than 7.0 mg/l from other than natural conditions. (13) Flow: There shall be no alteration of flow that will impair the waters for their designated uses. (14) Radioactivity: The Radioactivity should be kept at the lowest practicable levels, and in any event should be controlled to the extent necessary to prevent harmful effects on health. (c) Toxic Substances: (1) Toxic substances shall not be present in receiving waters in quantities that are toxic to humans or aquatic life, or in quantities that interfere with normal propagation, growth, and survival of sensitive indigenous aquatic life. For toxic substances lacking published criteria, bioassay data for sensitive indigenous test species/lifestages may be used to determine compliance with these narrative criteria (2) Standards for toxic substances are listed in Appendix 1. (3) Note that any future standards which may be derived for toxic substances, and added to Appendix 1, shall be as protective as those which would be derived using the methodologies for calculating water quality criteria found in 40 CFR Part 132. (4) SRMT Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs): SRMT has an ARAR specific to a class of pollutants called Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) (TCR NO. 89-19). The ARARs are applicable to ambient conditions and cleanup standards as follows: Media Concentration Sediments 0.1 ug/kg Soils 1.0 ug/g Surface Waters 1.0 pg/l Groundwaters 10.0 pg/l Air 5.0 ng/m3 (d) Biological Criteria: (1) All surface waters of the Tribe shall be of sufficient quality to support aquatic life without detrimental changes in the resident aquatic communities. (2) Tribal surface waters shall be free from substances, whether attributable to point sources discharges, nonpoint sources, or instream activities, in concentrations or combinations which would impair the structure or limit the function of the resident aquatic community as it naturally occurs. (3) Determination of impairment or limitation of the resident aquatic community shall be based on a comparison with the aquatic community found at an appropriate reference site or region. (e) Wildlife Criteria: (1) All surface waters of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe shall be of sufficient quality to protect and support all life stages of resident and/or migratory wildlife species which live in, on, or near the waters of the Akwesasne Territory. (2) Specific Wildlife-based Standards for toxic substances are listed in Appendix 1. (f) Wetlands: (1) All wetlands within the exterior boundaries of the territory that are not constructed wetlands shall be subject to the Narrative Criteria ( this section , subsection (b)), Antidegradation (section 2) and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Wetlands Protection Act. www.srmtenv.org/wetlands (2) Water quality in wetlands shall be maintained at naturally occurring levels, within the natural range of variation for the individual wetland, unless otherwise specified and approved by the Environment Division. (3) Physical and biological characteristics shall be maintained and protected by: (A) Maintaining hydrological conditions, including hydroperiod, hydrodynamics, and natural water temperature variations; (B) Maintaining the natural hydrophytic vegetation; (C) Maintaining substrate characteristics necessary to support existing and designated uses. (4) Point and Nonpoint sources of pollution shall not cause destruction or impairment of wetlands except where authorized under Section 404 of the CWA.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 5.02.060 Designated Uses (a) Primary Contact Recreation and Ceremonial Use. Primary contact recreation and ceremonial use means the use of a stream, river, or impoundment involving the following: prolonged contact and the risk of ingesting water in quantities sufficient to pose a health hazard (including but not limited to swimming, skin diving and water skiing) or religious, cultural, and traditional activities of the members of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and Mohawk Council of Akwesasne, or citizens of the Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs (including but not limited to collection of medicinal plants and collection of water for ceremonial use). Standards specific to the use are as follows: (1) The open water shall be free from algae in concentrations causing nuisance conditions, or gastrointestinal illness or skin disorders. (2) E. coli. Levels shall not exceed a 30-day geometric mean of 126 per 100 ml, nor shall more than 10 percent of the samples collected in the same 30 days exceed 410 CFU/100 ml. Table 1. Designated Uses The Designated Uses described herein shall not be used to limit any treaty right of the Saint Regis Mohawks or Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs. Below is a list of Designated Uses for the three major rivers within the boundaries of the Saint Regis Indian Reservation and are presented here to give examples of current Tribal uses specific to each water body. The water bodies are classified as follows: St Lawrence River, Class A-S; Raquette River, Class B; and St. Regis River, Class B. This is not intended to be exhaustive list of uses for these water bodies.

Under normal flow conditions it is estimated that this contribution is reduced to between 0% and 2% of daily intake. ** Subsistence fish consumption has been an ongoing practice ; however, the current WQ does not does not support this use for all individuals. Women of child bearing age and children are advised to restrict consumption to certain species and reduced quantities (fewer than 8, 4 oz. portions per month). SRMT currently defines subsistence fishing as consuming locally caught fish at a daily average rate of 150g/dy or 40 portions per month. ( Res. No. 2022-04 ; Res. No. 2020-02 ; Res.

The effluent limitations in Table 2 (below) apply to all dischargers to ground waters of the Tribe. Unless a demonstration is made to the contrary, it shall be presumed that a discharge to the ground or unsaturated zone is a discharge to groundwater. The groundwater effluent limitation is the maximum allowable concentration in micrograms per liter (ug/L), unless otherwise noted. B. In addition to the chemical characteristics provided in this section, coliform or pathogenic organisms shall not be discharged in amounts sufficient to render ground waters detrimental to public health, safety or welfare. C. The Division may establish additional groundwater effluent limitations. D. The groundwater effluent limitations shall be incorporated in NPDES permits for discharges to ground waters, where applicable.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 5.03.010 (a) INTRODUCTION It is the tradition of the Mohawk People to look generations forward in planning. It is with this foresight that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Solid Waste Management Code (\"Code\") is intended. Solid waste disposal practices need to be maintained in good harmony with Mother Earth since these practices will have an effect on the future generations inheriting this land. Adherence to this chapter will ensure that best practices for solid waste management are maintained. (b) AUTHORITY The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (\"Tribe\" or \"SRMT\") has the inherent authority to manage and regulate the storage, collection, transportation, handling, treatment and disposal of solid waste in a manner which best protects Mother Earth, her natural resources, and the health, welfare, and economic security of this generation of Mohawk People and the generations to follow. The Tribe retains the inherent sovereign power to exercise civil authority and jurisdiction over the conduct of both Tribal and non-Tribal members on all lands within the Saint Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation (\"Reservation\"). These civil actions will be taken when necessary to maintain the environment, natural resources, public health, safety, welfare, political integrity and economic security of the Tribe. (c) PURPOSE This chapter does not allow for the improper disposal of any Solid Waste on the Reservation. Improper disposal or creating an Open Dump of any Solid Waste materials or recyclables, whether on the side of the road, in the Community Recycling Depot, or anywhere that they should not be disposed of, will be considered a violation of the Code. Disposal of such Solid Waste or creating an Open Dump site is different than someone who litters as outlined in the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Traffic Code Section III(5)(f) ( TCR 2018-09 or as amended). It is the intent of this chapter to create a comprehensive integrated waste management policy that requires all solid waste to be disposed of properly at management facilities on and off the Reservation. This chapter encourages Mohawk People to reduce, recycle and reuse those materials that do not belong in the waste stream. Education of the community through diverse media has been a continuing process, aimed at eliminating the poor solid waste disposal practices of the past. The Code intends to: (1) Protect the health and safety of Tribal members and all other persons within the Reservation; (2) Protect the cultural, social and economic stability of residential, agricultural, commercial, industrial, forest, riparian, and environmentally sensitive lands within the Reservation; (3) Protect the historical and cultural values and traditions of the Tribe, Mohawk land as a permanent Tribal homeland, and maintain its aboriginal character; (4) Prevent solid waste pollution, including contamination of the Tribe's groundwater, surface waters, drinking water supplies, and all other natural resources; (5) Prevent the deterioration of the environment, standard of living, quality of life, welfare and well-being of all persons within the Reservation; and (6) Provide and promote Tribal waste management efficiency and services within the Reservation.

A guidance document may also provide direction as to how the Director of the Environment Division interprets the Tribe's solid waste permit program, consistent with Tribal laws and this chapter . (13) Hauler A person or commercial establishment that is in the business of collecting and transporting solid wastes and who has obtained a Tribal permit from the SRMT's Compliance Department (\"Compliance Department\"). (14) Hazardous Waste A waste that: (A) Because of its quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics, may either cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or serious irreversible or incapacitating illness. It may pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health, living organisms, or the environment when improperly handled, treated, stored, transported, or disposed of; or (B) Is specifically defined to be hazardous or toxic, including but not limited to any substance, material, smoke, gas, particulate matter, or combination thereof. Materials containing asbestos, petroleum or its byproducts, or Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs); or (C) Is hazardous, toxic, ignitable, reactive, or corrosive, and that is defined and regulated as such by the Tribe. (15) Household Hazardous Waste Chemical products such as paints, solvents or pesticides generated from normal household activities (e.g. routine house and yard maintenance).

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 5.03.040 Proper Handling, Collection and Disposal of Solid Wastes (a) INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT An integrated waste management approach shall be used for the management of Solid Wastes. This approach shall promote reducing, reusing, and recycling, followed by disposal. The Environment Division may issue rules and regulations for reducing, reusing, and recycling of solid wastes on the Reservation. Proper and safe practices based on industry standards will be developed to increase safety in the recovery phase of these efforts. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe will abide by restrictions on recyclables at the landfill (County of Franklin Solid Waste \"Local Law No. 3\".) The following rules apply to this Solid Waste Code for recyclable materials: (1) All recyclables shall be separated from Municipal Solid Waste (2) Designated Recyclables shall not be contaminated with hazardous waste or any other solid waste. (3) Recyclables will be delivered in a manner to follow these requirements or they may be rejected. (b) OPEN DUMPING The open dumping of Solid Wastes on the Reservation is disrespectful and does irreparable damage to the land and the environment. Much of this waste can last longer than seven generations and can affect even more generations through contamination of: soil, groundwater, and surface waters. Proper disposal of these materials can be accomplished through the utilization of Management Facilities, Haulers and/or taken directly off reservation to permitted disposal areas. It is a violation of this chapter for anyone or business to operate an Open Dump site. If there is an allegation of an Open Dump site it shall be investigated. The Open Dump site shall immediately cease to operate and violator will be subject to enforcement actions as outlined in Section 5.03.060(c) . if the matter was not resolved under Section 5.03.030(a)(2) . It is a violation of this chapter to dump, scatter or place any solid wastes anywhere except at a duly authorized and designated solid waste transfer station or landfill. Any written or verbal allegation of open dumping shall be forwarded to the Compliance Department to investigate. If the alleged violator's conduct does not cease after the Compliance Department has undertaken efforts to seek cooperation to stop the offending behavior, it may then determine whether to refer the matter to Tribal Police or the Environment Division for further enforcement action. If there are further enforcement actions and the matter is brought to the Tribal Court, it shall be dealt with according to Section 5.03.060(d) . (c) BURNING OF SOLID WASTE Any burning of Solid Wastes will be done in accordance with the open burn regulations established by the Environment Division's Clean Air Program (see TCR 2002-59 or as amended) (d) HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTES On specified days during the calendar year, certain Household Hazardous Wastes will be accepted at specific drop off areas on the Reservation for proper disposal. Only on those days and at those locations will a limited number of prohibited special wastes be accepted. The wastes allowed will be listed and announced thirty (30) calendar days prior to the collection date by the Director of the Environment Division. All items to be included in the Household Hazardous Waste collection will be compiled on a list by the Director of the Environment Division. The permitted items will be announced in a locally circulated newspaper, the Tribe's website, social media and radio for at least three (3) consecutive weeks prior to collection activities. Disposal methods and containers will follow recognized standards established by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Rules and regulations adopted by the Environment Division may be used if those methods specified meet or exceed the minimum standards established by USEPA and OSHA. If the Director or any employee involved with the collection of Household Hazardous Waste is in doubt regarding the safe handling of a product, then such product will be returned to the individual who transported it to the collection point. Collection of Household Hazardous Waste will occur based solely on the availability of funding. If the Environment Division deems that regularly scheduled collections are necessary in its discretion, under rules and regulations to be adopted by the Environment Division, then the necessary steps and procedures will be taken to assure regularly scheduled collections. Disposing of Household Hazardous Wastes except as outlined above at a Management Facility located on the Reservation is a violation of the Code. (e) SPECIAL WASTES The Environment Division may prohibit the disposal of other Solid Wastes at Management Facilities on the Reservation, as it deems necessary, under rules and regulations to be adopted by the Environment Division. The Environment Division shall issue rules and regulations governing the disposal or prohibition of disposal of other Solid Wastes not listed herein, including but not limited to, ashes and powders, and mineral wastes and soils. The Environment Division shall develop rules and regulations for special wastes, which require special handling, treatment and disposal. Tribal Departments or agencies, private enterprises, Haulers or any other person are prohibited from disposing of the following Special Wastes at any management facility located within the Reservation. Only Haulers who follow applicable Tribal, Federal and State laws and regulations shall collect and transport Special Waste within the Reservation and from the Reservation. ( Res. No. 2020-09 .)

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 5.04.010 Purpose The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (The \"Tribe\"), is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all community members. With respect to pesticide usage it has the authority, responsibility and jurisdiction to exercise sovereign rights in governing pesticide usage on the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation (Reservation). Through its Environment Division, the Tribe has determined that the management of pesticides through Tribal regulation will ensure the protection of Tribal member health by reducing unnecessary health risk exposures to pesticides. Further, the EPA's regulations under Environmental Protection Acts, Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 171 provide that: (a) An Indian tribe may develop its own plan for certifying private and commercial applicators to use or supervise the use of Restricted Use Pesticides (RUPS), subject to the approval of EPA; (b) If a tribe does not develop its own certification plan, the tribe may choose to utilize a state's certification program, with the concurrence of that state, subject to the approval of EPA; or (c) EPA can implement a federal plan for the certification of applicators of RUPS where no other EPA-approved state or tribal applicator certification plan is in effect. The Tribe's strategy for regulating pesticide usage within its jurisdiction is to exercise option 3, relying upon EPA to certify RUP applicators. Additionally, the Tribe will exercise its sovereign right to regulate the use of General Use Pesticides (GUPS) within its jurisdiction through this regulation. ( Res.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 5.06.020 Statement of Findings (a) The wetlands of Akwesasne have since time immemorial played a critical role in sustaining Akwesasne cultural traditions, health and welfare. (b) Considerable acreage of freshwater wetlands in Akwesasne has been lost, polluted or impaired by unregulated draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution or other acts inconsistent with the natural uses of such areas. The wetlands that remain are in jeopardy of being lost, destroyed or impaired by such unregulated acts. (c) Wetlands conservation is a matter of Tribal concern, calling for uniform Tribal regulation since a wetland in one region of Akwesasne is affected by acts on rivers, streams and wetlands of other regions. (d) Any loss of wetlands deprives the people of Akwesasne of some or all of the many and multiple benefits to be derived from wetlands, including, but not limited to: (1) flood and storm control by the hydrologic absorption and storage capacity of wetlands; (2) protection of subsurface water resources and provision for valuable watersheds and recharging ground water supplies; (3) pollution treatment by serving as biological and chemical oxidation basins; (4) erosion control by serving as sedimentation areas and filtering basins, absorbing silt and organic matter and protecting channels and harbors; (5) education of future generations by providing readily accessible outdoor bio-physical laboratories, living classrooms and vast training and education resources; (6) open space and aesthetic appreciation by providing areas for hunting, gathering, fishing, canoeing, bird-watching and camping often in the only remaining open areas along increasingly crowded river fronts; (7) provision of critical wildlife habitat; and (8) support of valuable medicinal plants and trees of cultural and economic importance including, but not limited to, Heartweed ( Polygonum persicaria ) and BlackAsh ( Fraxinus nigra ). (e) Regulation of wetlands, in accordance with the exceptions established in Section 5.06.050 of this ordinance, is consistent with the legitimate interests of farmers and other landowners to graze and water livestock, make reasonable use of water resources, harvest natural products and medicinal plants of the wetlands, selectively cut timber and otherwise engage in the use of land for agricultural purposes.

(d) \" Pollution \" shall mean the presence in the environment of conditions induced by humanity or any substances in quantities or characteristics which are or may be injurious to human, plant or wildlife, or other animal life or to property. (e) \" Wetlands \" means lands and waters of Akwesasne as shown on the wetlands map and that are seasonally or permanently flooded by shallow water as well as lands where the water table is close to the surface; in either case the presence of abundant water has caused the formation of hydric soils and has favored the dominance of either hydrophytic or water tolerant plants which are dependant upon or tolerant of very moist conditions. Wetlands may or may not contain species that are of value culturally to the Mohawks of Akwesasne. Lands that are under active agricultural use that are periodically flooded, soaked, or wet are not considered to be wetlands by definition. (1) Wetlands are comprised of marshes, bogs, swamps and fens supporting aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation: (A) \" Marshes \" are wet areas periodically inundated with standing or slowly moving water and/or permanently inundated areas characterized by emergent herbaceous vegetation, and to a lesser extent, anchored floating plants and submergents. (B) \" Bogs \" are peat covered areas or peat filled depressions with a high water table and a surface carpet of acidophilic mosses (chiefly Sphagnum). The water table is at or near the surface in the spring, and slightly below during the remainder of the year. (C) \" Swamps \" are wooded wetlands including both forest swamps and thicket swamps, with 25% cover or more of tall trees and shrubs. In swamps, standing to gently flowing waters occur seasonally or persist for long periods on the surface. (D) \" Fens \" are peat accumulating wetlands characterized by surface layers of poorly to moderately decomposed peat, often with well decomposed peat near the base. They are generally covered by a dominant component of sedges although grasses and reeds may be present. Fens receive some drainage from surrounding mineral soil and supports marsh-like vegetation. (E) \" Wooded Wetlands \" are wetlands dominated by trees; a forested wetland. (F) \" Wet Meadows \" are grasslands with nearly saturated soil near the surface, but without standing water for most of the year. (G) \" Open Water \" refers to water that is free of emergent vegetation or artificial obstructions. (H) \" Emergent Wetland \" refers to wetlands dominated by mostly herbaceous emergent vegetation. (I) \" Forested Wetlands \" are defined by the presence of trees which mostly cover the site (see, \"Wooded Wetlands\"). (J) \" Scrub/Shrub Wetlands \" exhibit wetland soils and hydrogeology, and are populated largely by shrubs, bushes or brush which are persistent year to year. (K) \" Reed Swamps \" refers to marshes dominated by Phragmites (common reed). (L) \" Slough \" refers to an elongated marsh often bisected by a creek with slowly flowing surface water. (M) \" Pot Hole \" refers to a shallow, marsh-like pond. (N) \" Peatland \" is a generic term for any wetland that accumulates partially decayed plant matter. (f) \" Emergent \" means rising above a surrounding medium, as in wetland plants protruding above the water level. (g) \" Wetlands map \" shall mean a map promulgated by the Environment Division by their authority under Section 5.06.040 of this chapter on which is indicated the general boundaries of any wetlands.

Review of the application shall be made by the Environment Division in accordance with applicable law and such rules as may be adopted by the Environment Division. The application shall include a detailed description of the proposed activity and a map showing the area of wetland directly affected, with the location of the proposed activity in relation to the wetland. (b) No sooner than thirty and not later than sixty days after receipt by the Environment Division of an application, and after notice of application has been published by the applicant either in a local newspaper, or by any means practicable, the Environment Division shall hold a public hearing on such application at a suitable location unless no notice of objection has been filed or unless the Environment Division finds the activity to be of such a minor nature as not to affect or endanger the balance of systems within the wetlands, in which case the Environment Division may, in the exercise of discretion, dispense with such hearing. At such hearing any person or persons filing a request for a hearing may appear and be heard. (c) The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the proposed activity will be in accord with the policies and provisions of this chapter .

(e) For permits whose issuance is reasonably calculated to affect wetlands that straddle Reservation boundaries, or over which jurisdiction is shared with some other governmental entity, the applicant shall forward copies of such application and proposed permit to the governmental entity affected by the issuance of such permit. The applicant shall provide notice to the Environment Division of such forwarding, and the Environment Division must allow at least 21 days for review and comment on such proposed permit prior to its issuance. \"Governmental Entity\" as used in this sub-part, refers solely and exclusively to the Governments of Akwesasne.

(b) In order to alleviate this situation, which exists on all Indian reservations and lands, Federal Agencies such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") have established Indian housing loan guarantee programs. (c) In order for the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe and its members to participate in any mortgage loan programs, whether guaranteed or conventional, for either residential or commercial purposes it must first establish the required legal and administrative framework to protect the interests of borrowers, lenders, and federal agencies which guarantee or mortgage loans. (d) One of the requirements for any mortgage loan program is to adopt adequate and clear foreclosure and eviction procedures to ensure a remedy for lenders in the event of a default. ( Res.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 7.06.040 Definitions As used in this code, the following words will have the meanings given them in this section unless the context plainly requires otherwise: (a) \"Adult person\" is any person eighteen (18) years of age or older. (b) \"AHA\" is the Akwesasne Housing Authority, established by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe for the purpose of constructing and maintaining dwellings for public use within the territorial jurisdiction of the Tribe; and which has been designated the Tribally Designated Housing Entity (TDHE) by the Tribe. (c) \"Assignee\" means an eligible tribal participant for whom a land assignment is conveyed in accordance with the provisions of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Land Assignment Ordinance. (d) \"Borrower/mortgagor\" is the Tribe, the AHA, or any individual tribal member(s) or any heir(s), successor(s), executor(s), administrator(s), or assign(s) of the Tribe who has executed a mortgage as defined in this code. (e) \"Building\" is a structure, and any appurtenances or additions thereto, designed for habitation, shelter, storage and the like. (f) \"Lender designated assignee\". Any lender or mortgagee as defined in this code may assign or transfer its interest in a mortgage or land assignment to a designated assignee. If the mortgage or land assignment falls under a federal agency homebuyer program or federal agency loan guarantee program, the lender must give written notice to the Tribe of a proposed designated assignee any time prior to such transfer or assumption. (g) \"Lender\" or \"mortgagee\" is (a.) any private lending institution established to primarily loan funds and not to invest in or purchase properties, (b.) the Tribe, (c.) the AHA, or (d.) a U.S. government agency which loans money, guarantees or insures loans to a borrower for construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation of a home. It shall also mean any lender designated assignee(s) or successor(s) of such lender/mortgagee. (h) \"Mortgage\" is the mortgage of an assignment of property given to secure a loan, and may be created (a.) under the auspices of any federal agency or AHA homebuyer or lending program, or (b.) any other loan, mortgage, security, or credit agreement entered between a borrower/mortgagor and a lender/mortgagee including conventional or traditional mortgages. This mortgage differs from a standard mortgage to the extent that this mortgage pledges the assignment interest as collateral for the loan, rather than pledging an ownership interest in the real property. (i) \"Mortgage Foreclosure Proceeding\" is a proceeding: (1) To foreclose the interest of the borrower(s)/mortgagor(s), and each person or entity claiming through the borrower(s)/ mortgagor(s), in a land assignment and building for which a mortgage has been given under the home purchase or lending program of any federal agency or any other lender, or a commercial loan by any lender; and (2) To assign, where appropriate the borrower's/mortgagor's interest to a designated assignee. (j) \"Person\" includes the Tribe, the AHA, an individual or organization, and where the meaning of a portion of this Code requires, it means a public agency, corporation, partnership, or any other entity. (k) \"Reservation\" means the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation which shall include all lands held in restricted status and in trust by the United States of America for the benefit of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe. (l) \"Shall\", for the purposes of this code, will be defined as, mandatory or must. (m) \"Subordinate lien holder\" is the holder of any lien, including a subsequent mortgage, perfected subsequent to the recording of a mortgage under this code. (n) \"Tribal Court\" is the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Court as established by the laws of the Tribe or such body as may now or hereafter be authorized by the laws of the Tribe to exercise the powers and functions of a court of law. (o) \"Tribal member\" means an individual who is an enrolled member of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in good standing. (p) \"Tribal Clerk\" is the duly elected tribal official designated to perform the recording functions required by this code or any deputy or designee of such person as assigned by Tribal Council. (q) \"Tribe\" means the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe of New York, as recognized by the United States of America. ( Res.

(c) In order for the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe and its members to participate in any mortgage loan program, whether guaranteed or conventional for either residential or commercial purposes, it must first establish the required legal and administrative framework to allow for Reservation land parcels to be used as a security interest for mortgages. (d) Currently, individual tribal member land interests on the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation are held pursuant to a tribal member's Deed of Right to Use and Occupancy that is approved by the Tribal Council and filed with the Tribal Clerk's office.

(b) If the parties cannot come to an agreement, or they state in the petition the divorce is contested under Section 11.02.120(d)(3) they shall go through a mediation proceeding to attempt to achieve a settlement agreement after the filing of the petition and answer, but prior to a full contested divorce. (c) If the divorce involves children as defined in Chapter 11.03 of this title , the parties shall attend mediation required under this chapter even if the divorce is uncontested, and if all child support matters cannot be resolved then child support shall be determined pursuant to Section 11.03.030(a)(2)(B) of this title . If a party wants child support to be paid through the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Child Support Enforcement Unit (SRMT CSEU) the child support payee shall need to register for services with the SRMT CSEU. If the parties do not want child support payments through the CSEU then the Court shall advise the parties of the option of obtaining its services post-judgment. If the child support portion of a divorce does not direct payment through the CSEU, then it may be modified by either party filing a petition to modify or enforce the judgment of divorce upon a showing of a change in circumstances or failure of the payor to follow the child support portion of the divorce including non-payment. At any time, any party can sign-up for services with the Tribe's CSEU to include modifying a judgment of divorce and/or enforcing a judgment of divorce.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 11.02.305 Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act (a) Purpose. This section is to provide an effective mechanism to obtain and enforce orders of custody and visitation across jurisdictional lines including temporary orders if the issuing court had the requisite jurisdiction. This section only applies to a child custody proceeding in which legal custody, physical custody, or parenting time to a child is an issue, which for this purpose of this Code is limited to a proceeding for a divorce, separation, custody or parenting time under this chapter , and protection orders from domestic violence, but excludes neglect, abuse, dependency, guardianship, termination of parental rights, juvenile delinquency, person in need of supervision, and contractual emancipation.

The Court shall treat a foreign country as if it were a state of the United States for the purpose of applying this section . A child custody determination made in a foreign country under factual circumstances in substantial conformity with the jurisdictional standards of this article must be recognized and enforced. The Court need not apply this section if the child custody law of a foreign country, as written or as applied, violates fundamental principles of human rights. (c) Effect of a child custody determination. A child custody determination made by a court that had jurisdiction under this section binds all people who have been served in accordance, with the laws of this Tribe or who have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court, and who have been given an opportunity to be heard. As to those people, the determination is conclusive as to all decided issues of law and fact except to the extent the determination is modified. (d) Notice. Notice required for the exercise of jurisdiction when a person is outside this jurisdiction may be given in a manner prescribed by the Tribe's Rules of Civil Procedure for service of process or according to the place where the person resides.

The Court on its own motion may order that the testimony of a person be taken in another jurisdiction and may prescribe the manner in which, and the terms upon which, the testimony is taken; (2) this Court may permit an individual residing in another jurisdiction to be deposed or to testify by telephone, audiovisual means, or other electronic means before a designated court or at another location in that state. This Court shall cooperate with courts of other jurisdictions in designating an appropriate location for the deposition or testimony; and (3) documentary evidence transmitted from another jurisdiction to this Court by technological means that do not produce an original writing may not be excluded from evidence on an objection based on the means of transmission.

Upon appropriate request by a court or law enforcement official of another jurisdiction, the Court shall forward a certified copy of those records. (h) Initial child custody jurisdiction. This Court may exercise jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination if: (1) the Court has jurisdiction under Section 11.02.030 ; (2) a court of another jurisdiction does not have jurisdiction under paragraph 1 herein, or a court of the home jurisdiction of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this Court is the more appropriate forum, and: (A) the child and the child's parents, or the child and at least one parent, have a significant connection with this jurisdiction other than mere physical presence; and (B) substantial evidence is available in this jurisdiction concerning the child's care, protection, training, and personal relationships; (3) all other courts having jurisdiction under paragraph (1) or (2) herein have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this Court is the more appropriate forum; or (4) no court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of this Subsection. (i) Exclusive, continuing jurisdiction. Except as otherwise provided in this section , this Court which has made a child custody determination has continuing jurisdiction over the determination until this Court determines it no longer has jurisdiction under this chapter and that substantial evidence is no longer available in this jurisdiction concerning the child's care, protection, training, and personal relationships. (j) Jurisdiction to modify determination. This Court may not modify a child custody determination made by a court of another jurisdiction unless: (1) this Court has authority to make an initial determination; and (2) the court of the other jurisdiction determines it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, or that this Court would be a more convenient forum; or (3) this Court or a court of another jurisdiction determines that the child or the child's parents do not presently reside in the other jurisdiction. (k) Temporary emergency jurisdiction. This Court may take temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in this jurisdiction and the child has been abandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child, a sibling or parent of the child so long as there is no order from another jurisdiction to be enforced. If there is an order from another jurisdiction then such order may be registered as outlined in subsection (o)(1) along with a request to enforce with an expedited hearing to be scheduled within three (3) days. A petition to register along with a request for expedited enforcement shall be served with a summons or order to the show cause as directed by the Court to the parent(s) and anyone who has physical custody of the child(ren) The Court shall not enter an order unless all of the necessary parties have been served. In any order related to an emergency or abandonment, the Court shall detail its findings regarding the emergency and if there is an existing order the basis for registering the order. The Court's findings shall include specific findings regarding the imminent risk to the health and safety of the child(ren) or the child(ren)'s abandonment. (l) Simultaneous proceedings. This Court may not exercise its jurisdiction regarding a child custody proceeding if, at the time of the commencement of the proceeding, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child has been commenced in a court of another jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this section , unless the proceeding has been terminated or is stayed by the court of the other jurisdiction because this Court is a more convenient forum. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter , this Court, before hearing a child custody proceeding, shall examine the court documents and other information supplied by the parties. If this Court determines a child custody proceeding has been commenced in a court in another jurisdiction having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with this section , this Court shall stay its proceeding and communicate with the other court. (2) In a proceeding to modify a child custody determination, this court shall determine whether a proceeding to enforce the determination has been commenced in another state. If a proceeding to enforce a child custody determination has been commenced in another state, the court may: (A) stay the proceeding for modification pending the entry of an order of a court of the other jurisdiction enforcing, staying, denying, or dismissing the proceeding for enforcement; (B) enjoin the parties from continuing with the proceeding for enforcement; or proceed with the modification under conditions it considers appropriate. (3) If a proceeding for enforcement under this section is commenced in this Court, and the Court determines that a proceeding to modify the determination is pending in a court of another jurisdiction having jurisdiction to modify the determination, the Court shall immediately communicate with the modifying court. The proceeding for enforcement continues unless the enforcing court, after consultation with the modifying court, stays or dismisses the proceeding. (m) Inconvenient forum. This Court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another jurisdiction is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the child, the law guardian, the guardian ad litem, or upon the court's own motion, or request of another court. (1) Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, this Court shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another jurisdiction to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including: (A) whether domestic violence or mistreatment or abuse of a child or sibling has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which jurisdiction could best protect the parties and the child; (B) the length of time the child has resided outside this jurisdiction; (C) the distance between this Court and the court in the other jurisdiction; (D) the relative financial circumstances of the parties; (E) any agreement of the parties as to which court should assume jurisdiction; (F) the nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child; (G) the ability of each court to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and (H) the familiarity of each court with the facts and issues in the pending litigation. (2) If this Court determines that it is an inconvenient forum, and that a court of another jurisdiction is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated jurisdiction and may impose any other condition the Court considers just and proper. (n) Duty to enforce. This Court shall recognize and enforce a child custody determination of a court of another state if the latter court exercised jurisdiction in substantial conformity with this section or the determination was made under factual circumstances meeting the jurisdictional standards of this section and the determination has not been modified in accordance with this section . This Court may utilize any remedy it has available to enforce a child custody determination made by a court of another jurisdiction. If the Court believes a child(ren)'s health or safety is at imminent risk of danger it may request the assistance of the Tribe's Indian Child Welfare Act (\"ICWA\") program to take the necessary steps to ensure the child's safety and ICWA may request the assistance of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Police Department. (o) Registration of child custody determination. In order to register a child custody determination, this Subsection shall apply and procedures outlined must be followed. (1) A child custody determination issued by a court of another jurisdiction may be registered in this jurisdiction, with or without a simultaneous request for enforcement, by sending to the Court: (A) a petition requesting registration; (B) two copies, including one certified copy, of the determination sought to be registered, and a statement under penalty of perjury that to the best of the knowledge and belief of the person seeking registration the order has not been modified; and (C) the name and address of the person seeking registration and any parent or person acting as a parent who has been awarded custody or visitation in the child custody determination sought to be registered. (2) On receipt of the documents required by subdivision (1) herein, the Court shall: (A) docket the petition together with one copy of the document sought to be registered and/or enforced; and (B) serve notice upon the persons named by regular mail and provide them with notice of the opportunity to be heard to contest the registration in accordance with this section . (C) The notice required by paragraph (b) of subdivision (2) herein must state the following: (i) a registered determination is enforceable as of the date of the registration in the same manner as a determination issued by this Court; (ii) a hearing to contest the validity of the registered determination must be requested within twenty (20) days after service of notice; and (iii) failure to contest the registration will result in confirmation of the child custody determination and preclude further contest of that determination with respect to any matter that could have been asserted. (D) A person seeking to contest the validity of a registered order must request a hearing within twenty days after mailing of the notice. At that hearing, the Court shall confirm the registered order unless the person contesting registration establishes that: (i) the issuing court did not have jurisdiction; (ii) the child custody determination sought to be registered has been vacated, stayed, or modified by a court having jurisdiction to do so; or (iii) the person contesting registration was entitled to notice, but notice was not given in the proceedings before the court that issued the order. (E) If a timely request for a hearing to contest the validity of the registration is not made, the registration is confirmed as a matter of law and the person requesting registration and all persons served must be notified of the confirmation.

(2) A putative father who is not the mother's husband may challenge the presumption of the husband's paternity and file a paternity petition on the basis of the child's best interest or on the basis of the husband's lack of access. (3) The SRMT-CSEU may challenge the presumption of paternity due to the husband's lack of access and may file a paternity petition. (b) Children Born Outside of a Marriage (1) The paternity of a child born outside of a marriage may be established through: (1) genetic testing, (2) as agreed between the parties, (3) as ordered by SRMT Tribal Court; (4) through an acknowledgment of paternity or (5) a birth certificate if the jurisdiction in which the child is born establishes paternity through a birth certificate. (2) A parent can revoke an acknowledgment of paternity within sixty (60) days of signing. A parent can petition the SRMT Court to revoke an acknowledgment of paternity if more than sixty (60) days has passed since signing it, but only on the grounds of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact. (c) Actions for Establishment of Paternity (1) Any interested party, including the biological mother, the putative father, the child's legal guardian, the child, or the SRMT-CSEU on behalf of the Tribe by assignment of interest from the custodial parent, may petition the court for the determination of the paternity of a child. No child support can be ordered unless paternity has been established. (2) Establishment of paternity under this chapter has no effect on Tribal enrollment, membership or eligibility for membership. Membership determinations are separate and distinct from the establishment of paternity. Any person wishing to file a membership application may do so with the Tribal Clerk of the SRMT. (d) Establishment of Paternity (1) A petition for the establishment of paternity shall contain the following information: (A) The name, date of birth and tribal affiliation (if known) of the child or children and the date ranges of conception; (B) The names, dates of birth, tribal affiliation (if known) and addresses of the biological mother and the putative father(s) in the action; (C) If there is a protective order in place, the address of the affected party and of any children shall be redacted from all court documents; (D) If there is reason to believe that emotional or physical harm may be inflicted should the whereabouts of a party or a child be disclosed, the petitioner shall state the reason and request the Court to issue an Order redacting the personal information from all court documents that respondent can access; (E) A statement regarding the father's access to the mother prior to the child's conception or birth; (F) A statement indicating if there has ever been any other proceeding including any state court or other tribal court, involving the child or children in the action for paternity, custody, placement or child support; and (G) A statement indicating whether the custodial party will be seeking a child support order if paternity is established; and (H) A copy of any order entered by a state court or other tribal court. (2) A paternity petition shall contain the following notices: (A) that if the parties agree, they have the right to voluntarily acknowledge paternity by executing an Acknowledgment of Paternity at Mediation or at the initial court appearance; (B) that either party can request genetic testing if paternity is contested by either party. The party requesting genetic testing, however, shall bear the burden of paying for it unless he/she can demonstrate why he/she should not pay for it; (C) that if child support is requested, it shall be determined using the child support guideline calculation; (D) that if paternity is established and child support is requested, that support shall commence from the date that paternity is established. (3) An Answer which denies paternity may rely on the following (A) The putative father was sterile or impotent at the time of conception; and/or (B) The putative father and the biological mother did not have sexual intercourse at the time of conception; or (C) That the mother was married to someone else at the time of the child's birth; or (D) The putative father is not the biological father of the child. (e) Initial Appearance for Paternity (1) If the putative father and the biological mother are willing to voluntarily acknowledge paternity without the use of genetic tests, the Tribal Court shall issue a final order establishing the putative father as the legal father of the minor child. (2) If paternity is contested, the SRMT Tribal Court shall order that genetic testing be performed within ten (10) days of the hearing. The Order shall contain the date, time and location of the genetic testing and shall comply with the requirements of this chapter . (3) Upon proper notice in the Summons, if one or both parties fail to appear at the initial court appearance, a Default Order of paternity shall be entered unless the party who failed to appear requested that the appearance date be changed or notified the Court that he/she was unable to attend the hearing for good cause. A party may only request one change to the court date or be excused once for good cause. Thereafter, failure to appear at a rescheduled court date shall result in an automatic default judgment. (f) Circumstances Where Paternity May Not Be Established (1) If the child subject to the action was conceived as a result of forcible rape or incest, and the victim or guardian has requested that paternity establishment not proceed, SRMT- CSEU will not file an action in Tribal Court for paternity establishment. If this information is received following the filing of the Summons and Petition, the Tribal Court shall dismiss the action. If SRMT-CSEU filed the action, it shall request the dismissal from the Tribal Court. (2) In any case in which a legal proceeding for adoption is pending, if, in the opinion of the SRMT-CSEU, it would not be in the best interests of the child to establish paternity, an action for paternity establishment will not be filed. If this information is received following the filing of the Summons and Petition, the Tribal Court may dismiss the action. If SRMT- CSEU filed the action, it may request the dismissal of the action by filing a motion for an Order to Dismiss. (g) Genetic Testing (1) In ordering genetic testing, the SRMT-CSEU or the SRMT Tribal Court shall ensure that: (A) Genetic test samples are collected by certified buccal swab collectors at the SRMT-CSEU; (B) Genetic testing samples are provided to an accredited genetic testing laboratory with a notice to where to send the results; (C) Results should be sent to the SRMT-CSEU if the parties attended Mediation and wish to resolve the matter without further litigation. If the matter is pending in Tribal Court the results shall be sent to it; (D) Once Tribal Court has received genetic testing samples it shall notify the parties and notify the parties of the next court date. Once SRMT-CSEU has received the results, it shall notify the parties and notify them of a new Mediation date; (E) If genetic tests show that the putative father is the biological father by a percentage of 99.0% or higher, paternity is presumed and the putative father shall be adjudicated the legal father; (F) Whenever the results of the genetic tests exclude the putative father as the biological father of the child, this evidence shall be conclusive evidence of non-paternity and the Tribal Court shall dismiss the action unless it finds good cause in the child's best interest to allow the matter to go forward; (G) If the paternity action was brought by the child's biological mother but she refuses to submit herself or the child to the genetic tests, the action shall be dismissed; and (H) Establishment of paternity under this section has no effect on Tribal enrollment or membership. (h) Final Paternity Hearing (1) If paternity was not established by voluntary acknowledgment at the initial court appearance, and a genetic test was ordered, a final paternity hearing shall be held where the results of the genetic testing shall be presented unless the parties agree to the establishment of paternity. The hearing shall be held no later than ten (10) days after the receipt of the genetic testing results. (2) Upon the Tribal Court's receipt of the genetic test results, it shall advise the parties of its receipt of the results. The SRMT Court Clerk shall then schedule the matter for a hearing. (3) If the genetic tests results indicate a probability of 99.0% or higher, the SRMT-CSEU shall file a Proposed Order, that: (A) Finds the putative father is the biological father based on genetic testing (B) Sets conditions for the repayment of any fees or costs associated with the paternity action including, but not limited to, genetic testing, service of process and modification of the official birth record. (4) If genetic tests establish that there is a probability of 98.9% or lower and there has been no showing by the preponderance of the evidence that the putative father named in the Petition is not the biological father, the SRMT-CSEU shall file a Proposed Order that the case be dismissed unless the Court determines there is good cause in the child's best interest to move forward with the hearing.

(3) Each party to the action shall complete a Release of Information Authorization which shall allow SRMT-CSEU to obtain additional financial records and to confirm any information provided by a party. (4) The following SRMT entities are required to release information to SRMT-CSEU for the purpose of establishing, modifying or enforcing a child support order: (A) All departments of SRMT; (B) Akwesasne Housing Authority and Community Development; (C) SRMT Tribal enterprises; and (D) Any person or entity doing business within the territory of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. (5) If a party declines to participate in Mediation, or otherwise fails to provide the required financial disclosure as outlined above, the Court and SRMT-CSEU will utilize imputed income to determine his/her child support obligation. (6) Financial information shall be kept confidential and full disclosure of information shall be available only to the Court and the SRMT-CSEU. When any financial documents are filed with the Court to be placed in the public docket, the Court shall redact all personal and confidential information such as social security numbers, employee identification numbers, tax identification numbers and all other identifying data. The Court shall order the parties to keep confidential any financial information obtained during the hearing. (7) Any financial information provided to SRMT-CSEU or the Court shall be used for the sole purpose of establishing, modifying, or enforcing child support. (d) Child Support Guidelines (1) Every four (4) years, SRMT-CSEU shall prepare a Child Support Standards Chart (CSSC) guideline which shall serve as a guide to parties and the SRMT Court in determining the basic child support obligation. The chart shall be broken down by annual income ranges and by the number of children in a case. It shall establish the upper limit of the combined parental income. To receive an amount of child support above that upper limit the parents can mediate such an amount or the Court can deviate based on the child's needs. (2) A parent's child support obligation shall be established utilizing the annual gross income of the CP and NCP. If a parent's income is unknown or if the parent is unemployed, imputed income may be used when calculating the child support. (3) Child support is based on a percentage of income determined by the number of children as follows: (A) 17% for one child; (B) 25% for two children; (C) 29% for three children; (D) 31% for four children; (E) No more than 35% for five or more children. (4) Child support obligations may be impacted by a \"Self-Support Reserve\" (SSR) which shall be one hundred thirty-five percent (135%) of the poverty income guidelines amount for a single person as reported by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services and shall be part of the child support calculation. (5) Child support obligations shall be based on the percentages contained in this section and shall be represented as a whole dollar amount in the Court Order, unless the Court finds good cause to deviate pursuant to Section 11.03.050(f)(4) from the SRMT CSSC or based on the child's needs. (e) Child Support Calculations (1) Worksheet . The Child Support Calculation Worksheet provided for in this chapter will determine the proposed amount of child support a parent will be responsible for. The worksheet will be completed utilizing the following steps: (A) Determine Total Gross Annual Income of each parent . Total Gross Income is determined by totaling all funds received from any source before taxes or other expenses of any kind are taken out. Total Gross Annual Income does not include public assistance payments or child support received or paid on behalf of children of other relationships (B) Determine Total Annual Deductions of each parent . Total Annual Deductions is determined by totaling all deductions from income which include federal, state, and local taxes, state unemployment and disability taxes, and social security taxes, union dues but it does not include deductions such as voluntary retirement contributions and transportation deductions. (C) Calculate Annual Net Income of each parent . Annual net income is calculated by subtracting the total annual deductions (b) above from the total gross annual income (a) above. (D) Calculate Combined Annual Net Income . Combined Annual Net income is determined by totaling the annual net income of the Custodial Parent's (CP) and Non-Custodial Parent's (NCP) annual net incomes with the maximum outlined in the CSSC of the Combined Annual Net Income. (E) Determine the Basic Child Support Obligation . To determine the Basic Child Support Obligation, multiply the Combined Annual Net Income by the appropriate child support percentage listed in the CSSC. (F) Determine Proportional Share of Combined Annual Net Income . To determine each parent's proportional share of combined annual net income in order to calculate their proportional share of the basic child support obligation, divide each parent's annual net income by the total combined annual net income. (G) Calculate Basic Child Support Obligation without consideration of low-income limitations . To calculate each parent's Basic Child Support Obligation without considering low income limitation, multiply the basic child support obligation by each parent's proportional share of combined annual net income. (H) Determine Low Income Limitations . Low income limitations are determined by utilizing the current Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and the Self-Support Reserve (SSR) as reported by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. These limitations are calculated by subtracting each parent's basic child support obligation from their annual net income and then comparing the result with the current FPL and SSR. If the amount falls between the FPL and the SSR, then the presumptive amount will be $25.00 per month ($300.00 annually). If the amount falls below the FPL, then the presumptive amount will be $0.00. If the amount is greater than the SSR, then the low-income limitations do not affect the obligation and the presumptive amount will be the Child Support Obligation as calculated. (I) Determine Social Security Offset . If a child is receiving Social Security cash benefits as a result of the parent's disability, the amount owed for child support shall be reduced by the amount of the child's monthly cash benefit. Should the child's monthly cash benefit exceed the amount of the monthly child support obligation there shall be no credit against any child support arrears. (J) Offset for other child support obligations . If a parent has more than one child support case, any prior child support obligation shall be deducted from his or her gross income. (K) Amount above maximum of CSSC . If the Combined Annual Income is above the statutory amount of the CSSC then the NCP is responsible for the Basic Child Support Obligation and whatever other amount above the statutory amount as agreed between the parents or as determined in the Tribal Court's discretion utilizing the factors from Section V(E)(4). (2) Medical Costs . Medical support may be considered if one or both parents have accessible and affordable health coverage available for the child at a reasonable cost. Reasonable cost is defined as being no more than 5% of a parent's gross income. If a child is eligible for Indian Health Service, the Tribal Court will not establish a medical support order. However, the Tribal Court may require parents to share in the child care expenses and/or extraordinary medical expenses not covered under any policy, plan, or Indian Health Service (IHS). (3) Non-Cash Support . Non-cash support may be considered by the Tribal Court in lieu of cash child support only when agreed upon by both parties. (A) In determining whether to permit non-cash support, the Tribal Court shall consider the current circumstances of the parties including whether a non-custodial parent is able to obtain employment, and the availability of other financial resources to meet the current cash child support obligation. (B) If a low-income limitation is determined, non-Cash Support may be considered per the SRMT Child Support Guidelines. (C) Non-cash support may not be ordered to repay assigned debts owed to a state or tribal jurisdiction. (D) All non-cash support orders must describe the type of non-cash support contribution and the SRMT Court must assign a dollar value to the contribution. (E) Should a non-cash support contribution not be met, the recipient of the non-cash support is required to notify SRMT-CSEU by the end of each month of the non- compliance in writing. If a notice of non-compliance is not received by the last day of the month, it shall be presumed the non- cash support contribution was met and the payor shall receive a credit based on the Tribal Court Order. (f) Child Support Establishment (1) Hearing . If the parties are unable to reach an agreement with respect to the child support and other conditions in Mediation, the hearing shall be held on the date and time shown in the Summons and Petition. At the initial appearance, the Court may enter a temporary based upon the Judge's discretion. (2) Child Support Worksheet . Prior to the parties' appearance the SRMT-CSEU shall file the Child Support Worksheet. After submitting such worksheet, if the SRMT-CSEU receives new information that impacts the child support obligation requested then the SRMT-CSEU shall file a new Child Support Worksheet with the Court with notice being provided to the parties that a new worksheet has been filed. Acceptable forms of notice include a letter to the parties or an email to the parties as long as there is proof of receipt. (3) Order . Following a child support hearing, the Court Order for Child Support shall contain the following information: (A) A statement that SRMT has jurisdiction over the child support case and personal jurisdiction over the respondent; (B) The amount of child support and any amount to be paid towards arrears, if any exist. Child support arrears may be ordered by the Tribal Court beginning from the date paternity was determined or the date in which the child support petition was filed; (C) The amount of work-related non-subsidized daycare or health insurance cost to be paid by the NCP; (D) A statement regarding the circumstances under which the child support obligation will terminate; (E) A statement that each parent shall notify SRMT-CSEU of any change of employer or address within ten (10) days of said occurrence; (F) A statement that if a payor becomes delinquent in an amount equal to one month's child support or fails to follow the terms of the Court Order, any and all enforcement remedies available to SRMT-CSEU under this chapter shall be taken; (G) An order to seek work if the NCP is unemployed or underemployed; (H) That each party may request a review of the support order once every twenty- four (24) months or sooner if there is a change in circumstances warranting a modification; (I) If the parties request that child support payments not be made to the SRMT-CSEU pursuant to a Federal Notice of Income Withholding, the Tribal Court will take testimony on how the parties intend to remit payments. If either the CP or NCP demonstrates that there is good cause not to require income withholding, the Court may enter such a finding. However, the order also shall state that if the payor becomes delinquent in an amount equal to one month's child support SRMT-CSEU may issue a Notice of Income Withholding and submit it to the employer or other source of income of the payor; and (J) A referral to any program the Court deems just and proper. (4) Deviation . There is a rebuttable presumption that the worksheet calculations are correct to support the requested award of child support. However, the Tribal Court has discretion to deviate from the child support calculation based on substantial evidence that the calculation would be harmful to the parent. If the Court decides to deviate from the calculations, the Court shall state in a written order the amount that would have been ordered had the guidelines been followed and the Court must justify such deviation. The Court may only rely on one or more of the following reason(s): (A) The financial resources of the child(ren) and or parent(s) require it; (B) One of the parents is a seasonal employee of a trade or profession; (C) The party has a verified and documented legal financial obligation to a person other than the child, to make payments, such as extraordinary medical or educational expenses; (D) The party has verified and documented extraordinary travel expenses incurred in exercising the right to periods of physical placement or visitation; (E) The party has verified and documented extraordinary travel expenses incurred to secure employment; (F) The best interests of the child including physical, mental and emotional needs and the child's educational needs; (G) The NCP already provides for the child's needs, without a child support order including but not limited to, shelter, food, and extracurricular activities. The NCP shall provide an affidavit attesting to this claim with supporting affidavits from school officials, social service workers, employers, and any other source that can substantiate the claim; or (H) An agreement by the parties for a deviation. (5) Default Order . When the respondent fails to appear or fails to answer a Petition filed herein, the Tribal Court shall enter a Default Child Support Order pursuant to Section 11.03.020(d) (A) In issuing the Default Order, the Court must also find that the Petition or the recommendation of SRMT-CSEU is based on available, relevant and material financial information and the respondent's child support obligation, at the amount provided for in the Default Order, has been correctly determined under the guidelines and schedule based on calculation of the income provided or based upon the child(ren)'s needs. (B) The Default Order shall be served on the respondent by the Tribal Court Clerk per the Service requirements at Section 11.03.020(c) . (C) A Default Child Support order may be reopened upon motion of the party and such motion to reopen shall be liberally granted for good cause. (6) Modification of Child Support Determination . Any party to an action may request a child support review from SRMT-CSEU to determine if there has been a substantial change in circumstances since the last order for child support or if the child support order has not been reviewed for twenty-four (24) months or more. A substantial change in circumstances includes, but is not limited to, a change in annual income of 15% or a change in the actual residence of a child(ren) has changed. If a modification is justified, the SRMT-CSEU shall file a petition for modification of child support. The petition shall be subject to the same procedures as an initial petition for child support including the requirement for Mediation, a worksheet calculation, and a court hearing to review the petition. (7) Termination of Child Support . Child support shall continue until the child reaches the age of twenty-one (21) years, unless emancipated pursuant to a valid court order. When the child reaches the age of twenty-one (21), the SRMT-CSEU shall file a motion with the Tribal Court to request the termination of any child order. (g) Payment of Child Support (1) SRMT-CSEU will be responsible for the receipting, distribution and disbursement of all child support payments pursuant to their IV-D Plan, (2) After an agreement is reached between the parties or the issuance of an order for child support, SRMT-CSEU, if appropriate, will file a Federal Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support (IWO) (Form # OMB0970-0154) and submit to the employer or other source of income of the payor. (3) An IWO shall indicate the amounts to withhold and any additional amounts to repay any arrearages pursuant to the terms of the Order. The employer must submit all amounts withheld to SRMT-CSEU no later than five (5) days following the date the income was withheld. (4) The maximum amounts allowed to be withheld from any source of income shall be no more than fifty percent (50%) of the payor's disposable income available for child support. For the purpose of calculating the amount of income subject to garnishments, Disposable Income means an individual's compensation (including salary, overtime, bonuses, commission, and paid leave) after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required to be deducted by law. Amounts required to be deducted by law may include federal, state and local taxes, state unemployment and disability taxes, social security taxes, and other garnishments or levies, union dues, but does not include such deductions as voluntary retirement contributions and transportation deductions. This requirement shall be so stated in the court order and any SRMT-CSEU correspondence. (5) If the Court has not ordered income withholding, the income of the NCP shall become subject to withholding, at the earliest, on the date when the payments which the NCP has failed to make are at least equal to the support payable for one month. In that case, SRMT- CSEU shall issue a Notice of Income Withholding and submit it to the employer or other source of income of the payor. (6) No employer shall refuse to honor a Notice of Income Withholding or a party's wage withholding request issued under this chapter . If the employer fails to withhold income in accordance with the terms contained in the Notice of Income Withholding, the employer may be held liable for all amounts that should have been withheld from the payor. The SRMT-CSEU has the authority and standing as the Tribal agency with authority to enforce this Tribe's interest in child support, to initiate an action to recoup such amounts. The SRMT-CSEU Standard Operating Procedures will provide detail on when and how this will occur. (7) An employer may not discharge, refuse to employ or take disciplinary action against an employee because his or her wages have been subjected to withholding for child support. Failure to comply with this section may subject an employer to appropriate penalties as to be determined under SRMT law or custom. (8) When there is no current child support order and all arrearages have been satisfied, the SRMT-CSEU shall promptly terminate an Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support and provide the employer or other source of income, a termination notice. (9) Parties will be provided with a detailed account statement, broken down by month, annually and upon request. The SRMT-CSEU will promptly refund amounts which have been improperly withheld. (10) The SRMT-CSEU shall allocate withheld amounts across multiple withholding orders to ensure that withholding occurs for each case and does not result in any case not being implemented. (h) Enforcement of Child Support Orders (1) Should a payor fail to pay his or her support pursuant to the Tribal Court Order, SRMT- CSEU may report the delinquency to credit bureaus and pursue any other enforcement action available under applicable law. (2) The SRMT-CSEU may take the following enforcement actions by requesting a court order for any or all of the following: (A) That any tribally issued licenses or permits, or other forms of \"permission needed\" licenses or permits issued by the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe from the Tribal Council be suspended or revoked; (B) That the gaming winnings of the payor be seized; (C) That the payor seek work if unemployed or under-employed; (D) That the payor attends classes to achieve a high school diploma or equivalent; (E) That the payor cooperates with SRMT-CSEU and follow any referrals made for services; (F) That the payor's non-essential personal property be seized and sold to pay off the arrears. (3) In the event that any of the foregoing does not result in the payor making his/her child support obligations or in the SRMT-CSEU's discretion any other enforcement efforts are futile the SRMT-CSEU may request assistance from other State and Tribal IV-D agencies to take any actions necessary to collect such support. Such actions may include but are not limited to: (A) Seizure of state and federal tax refunds; (B) Placement of liens on personal property or real property located off- reservation; (C) Passport denial; (D) Driver's license and professional license suspension; (E) Seizure of bank and other financial accounts; (F) A finding contempt and possible incarceration. (4) In the enforcement of any child support order, the following shall be exempt from execution as follows: (A) Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TAN-F); (B) All wearing apparel of every person in the family except that only $500 in value in furs, jewelry, beadwork and personal ornaments for the person owing the child support obligation; (C) Items of bona fide religious or cultural significance; (D) Equipment, vehicles, tools, instruments and/or other materials determined by the Court to be necessary to enable the payor to obtain income; (E) Any lands within the SRMT reservation that are used by the payor as a primary residence.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 12.01.030 Definitions (a) \"Boundary line agreement\" is a written agreement between adjacent landowners by which each landowner agrees to the written description of the location of the border that delineates each property-one from the other. (b) \"Certified Copy\" is a copy of a document that has been certified by the Tribal Clerk as a true and accurate copy of the original document. (c) \"Child(ren)\" / \"grandchild(ren)\" refers to a natural born or legally adopted child, or grandchild, as long as the child is a Tribal Member or eligible to become a Tribal Member. (d) \"Claimant\" is the person who files a land dispute claim in Tribal Court. (e) \"Interested Party\" is any Tribal Member who claims to have an interest in the outcome of the proceeding and who seeks to participate in a land dispute proceeding. \"Interested party\" does not include a Tribal member without a recognizable interest in resolution of the case. A Tribal Member seeking to participate as an interested party and who has an identifiable and known legal interest in the disputed property shall be treated as an Intervenor and will be bound by the Court's rulings. (f) \"Land Dispute\" is a disagreement between Tribal Members over claims to title, boundary lines, issuance or validity of deeds, transactions, and any other matter regarding property interests on the Reservation. The issuance of a Use and Occupancy Deed by the Tribe and the Tribal Clerk, even if in error, does not create a land dispute involving the Tribe. Any claim that a deed has been issued in error is to be resolved as a land dispute between the parties claiming an interest in the property and, when resolved, could result in a court order to the Tribe to issue a new deed or to revise or revoke an existing deed. (g) \"Legal Guardian\" is a parent or an individual legally appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction as the guardian of minor children. (h) \"Life estate\" is a way of holding real property that is limited to the life of the party holding it and, upon whose death, the property reverts to another Tribal Member. (i) \"Recorded\" refers to the filing or registration of documents or transactions with the Tribal Clerk's Office so as to memorialize the registration or transaction document in accordance with established procedures. (j) \"Respondent\" is the person against whom a land dispute claim is filed. The Tribe, the Tribal Council, the Tribal Clerk, or any tribal official may not be named as a Respondent in a land dispute for the official act of issuing a deed. This limitation, however, is subject to the limited waiver of immunity in this chapter . The Tribe may be named as a Respondent if a deed is issued to the Tribe itself or if the Tribe is claiming an interest in any land subject to a claim. (k) \"Spouse\" refers only to a legally married husband or wife. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe does not recognize \"common law\" marriage. (l) \"Tribal Council\" for purposes of this ordinance, refers to the three duly elected Chiefs of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. (m) \"Tribal Member\" for purposes of this ordinance, includes anyone who is enrolled with the Saint Regis MohawkTribe or eligible for enrollment with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. ( Res.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 12.01.040 Tribal Law, Customs and Practices (a) Application of Customs and Practices. The customs and practices of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe shall be applied in all situations where it is relevant to resolve a land dispute. (b) Order of Consideration. Written tribal laws will be considered first. If no written Tribal law applies to the circumstance raised in a dispute, the Tribe's customs and practices may be considered. (c) Resolution of Ambiguity. Where any doubt arises as to past practices and customs, the Court, with the agreement of both parties, may request the advice of Tribal Members who may be familiar with the Tribe's customs and practices, or the Court may pose a certified question to the Tribal Council or the Tribal Clerk. If issues of doubt regarding past practices and customs are presented in Tribal Court, the matter must be resolved through normal tribal court procedure for witness and evidence collection. (d) Acknowledgment. The Tribe acknowledges that Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs uses its own process to record property ownership of its members, which may be recognized by the Tribe as evidence of property ownership for the Tribe's land recording purposes or to resolve land disputes brought to the Tribe. (e) Guiding Legal Principles. In order to resolve land disputes according to tribal customs and practices, this chapter will set forth the general legal principles that have governed land use and occupancy on the reservation. (1) Power to Issue Deeds is Reserved . The power to make land assignments and to issue Use and Occupancy Deeds is vested in the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council as the sovereign government with jurisdiction and authority over the Reservation. The Tribal Council and the Tribal Clerk issue deeds in their official capacity based on deeds, contracts and other agreements or documents such as wills. (2) Resolution of Disputes . The Tribal Council shall exercise its discretion and judgment in issuing deeds and it may do so upon request of a Tribal Member with the presentation of proper documentation. It is recognized that a request to the Council to issue a deed may change the ownership of land in a way that may negatively affect a Tribal Member. The issuance of a deed by the Tribal Council and the Tribal Clerk does not constitute the resolution of a land dispute. If a Tribal Member disagrees with the recordation or issuance of a deed, the remedy is to file a land dispute claim in Tribal Court. (3) Forms of Evidence of Land Ownership . The following documentation may be considered valid evidence of land ownership for all or a portion of land identified in a Use and Occupancy Deed: (A) Official and Original or Certified Copy of a Use and Occupancy Deed issued and signed by the Tribal Council and recorded in the Tribal Clerk's records. (B) Valid Land Contract. (C) Valid Will (a will that meets the requirements of the Probate Law). (D) Valid Bill of Sale. (E) Valid receipt for the purchase of property if accompanied by other evidence to substantiate a sale of property. (F) Prior Tribal Council finding. (G) Prior Tribal Court finding. (H) Decisions from other Courts. (I) Sworn written testimony. (J) Sworn oral testimony. (K) Any other relevant evidence. (4) Limitation on Who May Use and Occupy Land. (A) Only Tribal Members shall be permitted to possess a Use and Occupancy Deed on the Reservation. A corporation, limited liability corporation, or trust either testamentary or inter vivos shall not be permitted to possess a Use and Occupancy Deed on the Reservation even if such entity is formulated under Tribal law; provided however that wholly-owned Tribal entities or those created by the Tribe that are formed for the benefit of the Tribe may use and possess land as needed. (B) In any case where a Tribal Member wants to transfer land to a minor Tribal Member, the land shall be held in trust by a legal guardian until the minor Tribal Member reaches the age of majority, which is eighteen (18) years old. When the minor Tribal Member reaches the age of majority the legal guardian's trust obligation shall no longer have any force or effect. The legal guardian shall have a fiduciary responsibility to the minor Tribal Member until the minor reaches the age of majority. (5) Limitation on the Right to Transfer . Reservation land may not be sold to, held by, pledged, assigned, or in any way relinquished to a non-member of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. (6) Assumptions Regarding Land Ownership . (A) When two or more Tribal Members are listed as owners of property and are granted the interest simultaneously, the owners shall be deemed joint tenants with rights of survivorship, unless expressly declared to be tenants in common. As joint tenants, the owners will own equal undivided shares. Upon the death of one of the tenants, that share will be distributed equally to the remaining tenants (survivorship). A joint tenant may transfer his/her share, but that transfer will automatically change the ownership between the transferring joint tenant and the non- transferring joint tenants to tenants in common. The transfer does not change the relationship between the non-transferring joint tenants. (B) If a deed declares the property will be held as tenants in common, each owner will own the property in equal shares unless different portions are expressly stated in the deed and each owner is entitled to possess the whole. A tenant in common may sell his/her share to anyone. If a tenant dies, there is no right of survivorship with the other tenants and that share will pass through inheritance as provided for in the Probate Ordinance. (C) A deed held by a husband and wife creates a tenancy by the entirety, unless expressly declared to be a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common. A tenancy in the entirety means that upon the death of one spouse, the property automatically passes to the surviving spouse and probate is not necessary. (D) These assumptions shall apply to all deeds existing on the date the amendments to this chapter are adopted unless the Tribal Member/s request the deeds be amended to reflect the intention of the owners that may be different than the assumptions enacted here. (7) Use and Occupancy Deed . A Use and Occupancy Deed is an official Tribal document granting the holder the right to use and occupy land at the will of the Tribe, signed by the Tribal Council and certified by the Tribal Clerk. (A) All land assignments and deeds made or issued by the Council are presumptively valid. The deed recorded first with the Tribal Clerk of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe will supersede all other deeds, unless it can be shown that the deed recorded first is subject to challenge under subparagraph (b). (B) A deed issued and/or recorded by the Tribal Clerk may only be challenged if (i) there has been a substantial error committed by the Tribal Council or Clerk in issuing the deed; (ii) there is evidence of fraud in the documents used to substantiate the issuance of the deed; or (iii) evidence of fraud, deceit, coercion or duress in the signing of documents or in the transfer made in the deed. The party challenging the deed has the burden of proof to show with clear and convincing evidence that a deed was not properly issued or recorded. (C) The Tribal Council has the right to correct or amend deeds in order to correct language or typographical errors and these corrections may not be reviewed. The Tribal Council also has the right to correct clerical errors, including errors that may have resulted in a deed being issued in violation of a previously recorded valid deed. Tribal Council, however, shall provide written notice to all affected parties of the error and of its intent to make a correction. (D) Correction of clerical errors may be challenged and shall be reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard, and a party may seek declaratory or injunctive relief. (E) If a land claim dispute is filed, all actions by all parties in relation to the property in dispute shall be stayed pending review. (F) All recorded deeds must bear the signature of the Tribal Council along with the signature and seal of the Tribal Clerk. (G) Use and Occupancy Deeds may be transferred between Tribal Members either through a land contract, a bill of sale, by simple purchase, or as a gift between family members. In order to ensure the Tribe's land records are current and accurate and reflect the current ownership, upon the effective date of this chapter , all transfers of Use and Occupancy Deeds shall be recorded with the Tribal Clerk. The failure to record a transfer which took place prior to the effective date of this chapter is not a basis to declare a transfer invalid. (H) Use and Occupancy Deeds may not be transferred to a non-member or non-Indian in any manner, and the Tribe reserves the right to declare invalid such a transfer. (8) Land Contracts . A land contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller for the purchase of a right to use and occupy a parcel of land where the buyer makes installment payments to the seller for the eventual conveyance of the Tribal Use and Occupancy Deed or right to occupy the property. The following shall be considered in assessing the validity of a Land Contract: (A) The agreement may be informal, but must be written. (B) The agreement shall provide that a buyer will receive a deed to the property when all of the conditions of the contract have been satisfied. (C) Each contract will differ, but many land contracts provide that the buyer may occupy and make improvements to the land, even though the complete right to use and occupy is not transferred until the land contract is fulfilled. Once executed, a land contract may be filed with the Tribal Clerk's office to provide notice to the community at large. If there are multiple land contracts the Tribal Court must have a hearing to determine which land contract takes precedence. (D) Upon the effective date of this chapter , to validate the final conveyance of the right to use and occupy property and to ensure the Tribe's Land Records are accurate and current, once a land contract is fulfilled, and if it was not previously recorded it shall be recorded with the Tribal Clerk and a Use and Occupancy Deed shall then be issued. The failure to record a contract that was fulfilled prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not be a basis to declare the contract invalid. (E) If the buyer defaults under the terms of the contract, the seller may seek to evict the buyer through a claim in Tribal Court, if necessary, and may keep the installment payments and any improvements thereon, unless the buyer can demonstrate to the Court's satisfaction that to return the land with the improvement along with keeping monies paid would result in the seller's unjust enrichment. The Tribal Court must have a hearing to determine if the buyer is entitled to any compensation. The Tribal Court must state its findings in a written order. (9) Bill of Sale . A Bill of Sale is a record of a purchase transaction between individuals for the exchange of their right to use and occupy a particular parcel of land and may stand as a deed conveying the right to use and occupy the property under tribal law. The following shall be considered in assessing a Bill of Sale: (A) As of the effective date of this chapter , the Bill of Sale must be signed, witnessed or notarized and then recorded with the Tribal Clerk in order to be a valid transfer of the right to use and occupy property. (B) In the past, Bills of Sale were not always recorded with the Tribal Clerk. In the event the Bill of Sale was not recorded, the Bill of Sale will be considered a binding document evincing an intent to transfer the right to use and occupy a property in the same manner as a deed, unless there is evidence expressly contrary to that intent. (C) In the instance that there are two Bills of Sale for one particular property, the Bill of Sale dated first will supersede any and all other Bills of Sale unless it can be shown to be invalid. A Bill of Sale may only be deemed invalid by the Tribal Court if there is evidence of fraud, deceit, coercion or duress in the transfer made in the Bill of Sale or in the signing of the document. The party challenging the Bill of Sale has the burden of proof to show with clear and convincing evidence that a document is invalid. (10) Survey of Tribal Lands . (A) For those transfers of property where a survey is required, the parties may either provide the survey themselves, subject to the approval of the Tribal Clerk, or the Tribal Clerk may provide assistance in obtaining a survey. The Tribal Clerk shall set a fee schedule for the cost of a survey, to be approved by the Tribal Council. For those Tribal Members who cannot afford a survey, they can submit a request to Tribal Clerk or his/her designee for a fee waiver, subject to availability of resources. The Tribal Clerk shall determine, based upon established guidelines, who shall be eligible for such a waiver. (B) Property transferred on the Reservation must be properly described with boundaries that are clearly delineated, measurable and not in dispute. As of the effective date of this chapter , a survey by a licensed surveyor is required for all parcels of land transferred on the Reservation unless: (i) there is an existing survey of the subject parcel that is less than ten (10) years old; or (ii) the parties and any affected adjacent landowners enter into a boundary line agreement that provides an accurate description of the property being transferred, and the parties agree in writing that a survey is not necessary and they agree to be bound to the property description; or (iii) the transfer is a family transfer and does not change the existing boundaries of the property, unless the Tribal Clerk deems it necessary. If the Tribal Clerk deems a survey necessary none shall be required if the affected adjacent landowners enter into a boundary line agreement. (C) Surveys for disputed land parcels: (i) If a parcel is not surveyed prior to a transfer and a dispute arises as to boundaries described within the transferring document, the parties to the transaction or adjacent landowners agree to be bound by an impartial survey by a third party, unless the transferring document is so ambiguous that the surveyor cannot complete the survey. In that instance, the Tribal Court shall be empowered to decide how the boundaries shall be surveyed, based on evidence presented in a Tribal Court proceeding. (ii) In resolving boundary disputes, the Tribal Court may not rely on GIS or other data to determine property boundaries. The parties shall provide the Court with surveys performed by licensed surveyors to support any claims regarding boundary lines provided that, in the case of ambiguity in a deed and relying on common law principles in drawing property boundaries, the Court may issue instructions to resolve an ambiguity so that a proper survey may be performed. If neither party presents a survey to the Court in a boundary dispute or in a case involving property lines, the Court may order a survey and assess the cost to the party or parties in its discretion.

(1) The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court shall have jurisdiction over land disputes. The Tribal Court shall have the authority to award monetary damages and equitable relief, provided however, that the Tribal Council retains the sole authority to issue, revise, or rescind a Use and Occupancy Deed. The Tribal Council is bound by any Tribal Court Order regarding land disputes, and failure to obey such orders shall subject the Tribe, but not the individual Council Members acting in their official capacity, to equitable or injunctive relief, as necessary to enforce the Order. (2) Tribal Court shall have jurisdiction over any land dispute that is commenced within six years of accrual of the injury or the date the party knew or should have known of the injury that serves as the basis of the claim. The Tribal Court has the discretion to waive the statute of limitations for good cause, such as where the party could not have known or was prevented from knowing of his or her injury. (b) Capacity to File a Dispute. A land dispute may be filed by: (1) Any enrolled Tribal Member; (2) A non-member on behalf of his or her minor, mentally or physically handicapped and dependent child(ren) or family member, as long as the child(ren) or family member is/are Tribally-enrolled; or (3) A non-member spouse who may seek a life estate after the death of his or her Member spouse. (c) Information Required. A Land Dispute Complaint shall contain the following information: (1) A Statement of the nature of the dispute, e.g. boundary line, title, ownership; (2) Names of all other Interested Parties, including Claimant and Respondent and their connection to the dispute and the reason for each party's interest; and (3) Copies of any relevant documents which may be required to address the dispute and which will inform the Court and the parties about the facts, including, but not limited to, Wills, Deeds, Use and Occupancy Deeds, Tribal Council Decisions, Surveys, Bills of Sale or any other relevant correspondence, or receipts. (d) Public Notice. (1) Within ten (10) days following the filing of the Claim, the Tribal Court Clerk shall publish a Notice which shall start the thirty-day (30) Public Notice Period.

(f) Applicable Laws and Rules. All Tribal Laws, including those pertaining to procedures before the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court shall govern the land dispute claims filed in Tribal Court.

But, to the extent there is a conflict, this chapter shall take precedence in relation to land and land disputes. (g) Review of Prior Tribal Council Land Dispute Decisions. (1) As a matter of equity, the statute of limitations will be waived and the Tribal Court shall have the authority to review any land dispute decisions made by Tribal Council between December 1, 1998 and December 3, 2009 (the original Effective Date of the prior Land Dispute Ordinance). Such review shall be de novo. This authority shall expire on June 30, 2018. (2) As of December 3, 2009, the Tribal Council no longer had authority to resolve land disputes. If, between December 4, 2009, and the date of the adoption of this chapter , the Tribal Council took action on a land dispute despite this bar, the party seeking to file a claim regarding such action must first establish that Tribal Council actually resolved a land dispute as defined herein before a claim may be brought. The Tribal Court shall have the discretion to waive the statute of limitations regarding a land dispute in such case, but in no instance, may the Tribal Council or Tribe be named as a party except as permitted under this chapter .

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 12.02.080 General Guidelines for Estate Distribution and Small Estates (a) Persons without a Will. The procedure in Subchapter 3 will apply for distribution of an estate without a Will. (b) Persons with a Will . The procedure in Subchapter 4 will apply for distribution of an estate with a Will. (c) Small Estates . (1) Basis for Using Small Estate Process. If a person dies and leaves an estate whose value is less than $20,000.00 and which does not include any interests in real property, the estate may be settled with minimal Tribal Court involvement so long as all of the heirs and beneficiaries agree to small estate administration and have signed a written waiver of their right to contest the estate. This may also include probate of personal property that is discovered from an estate that was informally probated prior to the enactment of this chapter . (2) Petition for Small Estate. For qualifying estates, an heir or the surviving spouse shall file an affidavit in Tribal Court which provides the following information: (A) A death certificate, record or some evidence to establish deceased's status; (B) the estimated value of the estate and the basis of that estimate; (C) a list of all known heirs; (D) a family tree obtained from the Tribal Clerk; (E) a written Will, if any; (F) a list of known debts to be paid from the estate; and (G) waiver from each heir and beneficiary consenting to the small estate administration. (3) Contents of Affidavit. The affidavit shall include a request that the estate be settled informally without having to admit the estate to probate along with the written consent of all heirs to the procedure. The affidavit may set forth the proposed estate distribution. (4) Requesting Party. If there is no surviving spouse, any of the deceased's next of kin or, if there is no next of kin, any suitable person whom the Tribal Court deems to have a sufficient interest may make the application. (5) No Administrator. It shall not be necessary to appoint an Administrator if the value of the deceased's property appears to be less than $20,000.00 in value, there is no real property, no heir or beneficiary objects, and no one requests that one be appointed. (6) Court Duty. Upon finding an estate qualifies for a small estate administration, the Tribal Court shall issue such orders and other documents as may be required for a small estate. It shall proceed as a small estate as long as no heir or beneficiary objects to it. (d) Limited Administration. If a person dies and his/her heirs and/or beneficiaries need certain limited relief that cannot await full probate of the estate the Tribal Court may allow heirs, beneficiaries, creditors, the Tribe, or other interested party to obtain a special appointment with notice to heirs to address that limited purpose. Tribal Court shall develop a petition for such purpose, determine each case for a limited appointment in its discretion and shall set limits in its order of appointment. The order of appointment shall be recorded in the Tribal Clerk's office in the same manner as outlined in Section 12.02.140(b) . If there is a subsequent estate that is probated, the limited administration and whatever action was taken shall be included in the decedent's inventory of assets. The Tribal Court's decision regarding a limited appointment is not considered a final decision for purposes of an appeal. (e) Renouncing a Share of an Estate. (1) Affidavit. A person who is an heir or a beneficiary by law or by Will may renounce in whole or in part the right to any estate property or interest. In order to renounce an interest or share of an estate, the person must file an affidavit with the Tribal Court not later than three (3) months after the deceased's death or the time at which it is determined that the person is entitled to take property. (2) Court Action. The affidavit shall describe the property or interest being renounced and the extent of the renunciation. It shall be signed under oath by the person renouncing the interest. If the Court accepts the affidavit then, when applying the rules of inheritance, the Court shall treat the person renouncing the interest or share of the estate as having predeceased the deceased and the interest or share shall pass according to intestacy rules. (f) Effect of Homicide on Beneficiaries. (1) Heir. A surviving spouse, heir or beneficiary who is found to have criminally and intentionally killed the deceased is not entitled to any benefits passing under this chapter and the estate of the deceased shall pass as if the killer had predeceased the deceased. (2) Right of Survivorship. Any person with a right of survivorship in personal or real property who criminally and intentionally kills a joint owner, joint tenant, or any other form of co-ownership has no rights by survivorship. This provision applies to joint tenancies in real and personal property, joint accounts in banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and other institutions, and any other form of co-ownership with survivorship rights. (3) Beneficiaries. A named beneficiary of a bond, life insurance policy or other contractual arrangement who criminally and intentionally kills the person upon whose life the policy is issued is not entitled to any benefit under the bond, policy or other contractual arrangement, and it becomes payable as though the killer had predeceased the deceased. (4) Other. Any other acquisition of property or interest from an estate by the killer shall be treated in accordance with the principles of this section. (5) Judgment. A final judgment of conviction of an offense containing the elements of criminal and intentional killing is conclusive for purposes of this section. In the absence of a conviction of criminal and intentional killing, the Tribal Court may determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the killing was criminal and intentional for purposes of this section. (g) Simultaneous Death . In some cases, title to property or the transfer of property depends upon an individual surviving the death of another person. An individual shall be deemed to have survived the other person if it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the other person by 120 hours. If it cannot be established by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the deceased by 120 hours, then that individual is deemed to have been predeceased. ( Res.

A certified or authenticated copy of a death certificate issued by an official or agency with the authority to issue a death certificate at the place where the death purportedly occurred is proof of the fact, place, date and time of death and the identity of the deceased.

In determining the heirs of an estate, the Tribal Court shall rely upon the information provided in the petition and the Family Tree and shall issue an order identifying those persons entitled under tribal law to share in the estate according to the principles set forth in this Ordinance. (b) Order of Inheritance . When a Tribal Member dies without leaving a Will, the following order of inheritance shall apply: (1) Surviving Spouse. A surviving Tribal Member spouse shall inherit the real property interest in Reservation land and all other property owned by the deceased spouse. A non- member spouse may only inherit a life estate in real property as provided for in Section 12.02.240 below but may inherit all of a deceased Member's personal property. A person who is divorced from the deceased or whose marriage to the deceased has been officially annulled is not considered a surviving spouse unless, by virtue of a subsequent marriage, he/she is married to the deceased at the time of death. A decree of separation, which does not terminate the status of husband and wife, is not a divorce for purposes of this chapter . (2) Children. If there is no surviving Tribal Member spouse, the surviving Tribal Member children shall each receive equal shares in the real property of the estate. All children shall share in the personal property of the estate. (3) Grandchildren. If there is no surviving Tribal Member spouse or surviving Tribal Member children of the deceased, surviving Tribal Member grandchildren shall each receive equal shares of the real property and all grandchildren shall share in the personal property of the estate. (4) Minors. In any case where minor Tribal Members may be entitled to an interest in real property, the land shall be held in trust by a legal guardian until they reach the age of majority, which is eighteen (18) years old. In any case where minors may be entitled to an interest in personal property that is sold the proceeds of the sale shall be held in trust until they reach the age of majority. (5) Parents. If there is no surviving spouse or descendants, the surviving Tribal Member parent(s) of the deceased shall each receive equal shares of the real property and any parent(s) shall share in personal property of the estate. (6) Siblings. In the event that a deceased Tribal member has no surviving Tribal Member spouse, children, grandchildren, or parents, the surviving Tribal Member's brothers and sisters shall each receive equal interests in the real property and shall share in the personal property of the estate. (7) Nieces/Nephew. In the event that a deceased Tribal Member has no surviving Tribal Member spouse, children, grandchildren, parents or siblings, the surviving children of the deceased Tribal Member's siblings, if any, shall each receive an equal interest in the real property and shall share in the personal property of the estate. (8) Aunts/Uncles. In the event that a deceased Tribal Member has no surviving Tribal Member spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, siblings or nieces and nephews then the surviving brothers and sisters of the parents of the deceased Tribal Member (aunts and uncles) shall each receive an equal interest in the real property and shall share in the personal property of the estate. (9) Divorce. The divorce of a husband and wife does not affect the right of their children to inherit from a deceased parent's property. (10) No Beneficiary. If there is no qualified beneficiary as outlined above, the estate shall pass to the Tribe. (c) Agreement on Plan for Distribution . If all of the heirs agree in writing on a plan for distribution different than set out in this Ordinance, the plan may be presented to the Tribal Court for approval and the Court shall exercises its discretion in whether to approve the plan based on fairness and equity. If the heirs have not agreed to a plan, the Tribal court shall apply the rules under tribal law for ownership and distribution to the heirs.

A person conceived before the deceased's death but born thereafter shall inherit as if he/she had been born in the lifetime of the deceased. (b) Adopted Person . A person who is legally adopted in a court of competent jurisdiction is treated as the natural child of an adopting parent. (c) Non-Marital Child Status. (1) Maternal. A non-marital child is the child of his/her mother so that he/she inherits from both mother and maternal relatives. (2) Paternal. A non-marital child is the child of his/her father so that he/she inherits from his/her father and paternal relatives if: (A) during the lifetime of the father a court of competent jurisdiction has issued a paternity order; or (B) the father of the child has signed a document acknowledging paternity.

(3) Agreement of Support. The existence of an agreement obligating the father to support the non-marital child does not mean the child is qualified to inherit from the father. (4) Non-Marital Child Inheritance. If a non-marital child dies, his/her relatives succeed to an inheritance as if the deceased was a marital child, provided that the father and the paternal relatives may inherit only if the paternity of the non-marital child can be established and if there is an Order of Support that the father have no arrears.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 12.02.150 Administrator Duties and Procedures (a) Preliminary expenses. The Administrator is required to pay for funeral expenses and any outstanding medical bills using the property of the estate, if available. The Administrator is not required to pay any expenses out of pocket. (b) Inventory . (1) List of Assets. The Administrator is required to take an inventory of all property and assets of the deceased. Assets may or may not include family heirlooms or items of sentimental value. This inventory shall be filed with Tribal Court within thirty (30) days after his/her appointment. The inventory should include an estimated value of all property and assets of the deceased. If an asset is of significant value, such as real property, an appraisal is recommended. The inventory should also indicate those items intended to be sold for the payment of debts or other estate requirements, if any. The Administrator shall provide a copy of this inventory to all persons with a known interest in the estate at the same time it is filed with the Court. (2) Advances. Property given to an heir during the deceased's lifetime shall not be treated as an advance against the heir's share of the estate unless the advance was declared in writing by the deceased or the heir at the time of the advance. Known advances should be listed in the inventory. (3) Objection to Inventory. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the inventory, any person with an interest in the estate may file an objection to the inventory or to the sale of any item in the inventory. (4) Hearing and Court Review. If objections to the inventory are filed, the Tribal Court shall schedule a hearing to be held within thirty (30) days. The Tribal Court shall notify all interested parties of the hearing. Upon consideration of the objections, the Tribal Court may order an amendment to the inventory or appraisal, or issue an order regarding the sale of property, as it deems just and proper to carry out the terms of the estate. (c) Creditors . (1) Identification. The Administrator is required to identify all creditors of the estate. To do so, the Administrator shall search the deceased's records for bills, notices, loan papers, and other documentation that suggests the deceased may have outstanding debts. The Administrator has the duty to contact all known creditors to determine amounts owed and the process for addressing bills and other debts. The Administrator shall also publish a public notice within thirty (30) days of appointment stating that all other creditors must present their claims to the Administrator and that only the claims presented may be considered for payment by the estate. The notice shall give the creditors thirty (30) days to respond and will clearly state the final date for claims to be presented. Unless there is a waiver or modification approved by the Court, the notice shall be posted on the Tribe's website, and published for three consecutive weeks in a publication of general distribution on the Reservation and if deemed necessary in the nearby towns of Massena and Malone. (2) Documentation. For those debts identified by the Administrator from the estate records, the Administrator shall prepare a list of the amounts owed and any necessary forms or documentation needed to resolve the debts and close accounts. Any other claims submitted by a creditor shall be presented in an affidavit and shall include documentation, such as writings or witness statements, as necessary for the Administrator and the Tribal Court to determine if the claim is valid. The creditor shall state under oath that its claim is justly due, that to the extent payments were made by the deceased they have been credited, and that it knows of no offsets against the claim. If a creditor fails to present a claim within the time period allowed, the creditor may request Tribal Court in its discretion allow it to file the claim directly with the Tribal Court at the same time the Administrator presents the creditors' claims under subsection (4) below. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied. (3) Administrator Review. Once the Administrator collects the creditors' claims, the Administrator shall review them and shall notify the creditors as to whether they are accepted or rejected and explain the reasons for the decision. The Administrator is required to make a decision and provide notice within thirty (30) days of presentation of the claim. (4) Court Review. (A) The Administrator shall notify the Tribal Court as to whether any creditor claims have been presented. (B) If there are claims, the Administrator shall provide the Tribal Court with a list of claims with supporting documentation explaining whether the claim has been accepted or rejected. The Administrator must present this information to the Court no later than forty-five (45) days after the creditor claim period has closed. (C) Rejected creditors have ten (10) days to respond to the list filed with the Court. If after ten (10) days, no objections are filed, the Court may approve the list and the Administrator may pay the approved claims. If a rejected creditor files an objection, the Tribal Court shall determine the validity of the claim and the objection, relying on the affidavit or personal testimony of the claimant. If an objection is filed, the Administrator may pay creditors only after the Tribal Court issues an order regarding the validity of the claims. At no time, shall the Tribal Court permit the sale of Tribal Land to satisfy an estate's debts except if the claimant can show that the deceased expected his/her land to be sold to satisfy the outstanding debt. (5) Timing In sum, the time frame for Administrators as set forth in this chapter is as follows: (A) Inventory. Within thirty (30) days after appointment, the Administrator will present an estate inventory to the Tribal Court. Objections to the inventory are to be filed with the Tribal Court no later than thirty (30) days thereafter. If objections are filed, the Tribal Court must hold a hearing within thirty (30) days. (B) Creditor's Claims. Within thirty (30) days after appointment, the Administrator must publish a public notice asking for creditors to bring forth their claims. A Creditor will have thirty (30) days from the date of the last public notice to file a claim with the Administrator. The Administrator will have thirty (30) days from the filing of the claim to decide whether to recognize the creditor's claim. If claims are filed or debts are identified, the Administrator must file a list of claims with the Tribal Court within forty-five (45) days after the claim period closes. Rejected creditors have ten (10) days to file with the Tribal Court documentation explaining why they should be paid. (d) Distribution of Estate. The Administrator is responsible for distributing the estate once heirs are identified and the creditors, if any, have been identified. (1) Creditors. All verified claims of creditors allowed by the Tribal Court and identified debts shall be paid before distribution of the estate to the heirs. (2) Accounting. Before distributing the estate to the heirs, the Administrator must provide the Tribal Court with an accounting of the estate assets for approval. The accounting will show all disbursements made for expenses and creditors, and shall include receipts. The accounting will also show the computation of any attorney's and/or Administrator's fees for which approval is sought. The accounting will set out the remaining estate to be distributed and contain a statement that the estate is ready to be distributed to the heirs. The accounting may include a signed consent form from each heir to the proposed distribution from the estate. (3) Advances. When distributing property among the heirs, any property that was advanced is valued at the time the heir came into possession of the property. (4) Administrator Fee. If an Administrator requests a fee, the Tribal Court shall establish the percentage for compensation on a case by case basis, but in no event shall the percentage be more than five (5%) percent of the total value of the gross estate. (e) Order Approving Distribution and Closing of Estate. (1) Order of Distribution. When the Tribal Court is satisfied that an estate is ready to be distributed and the Administrator has set out the plan for distribution in the accounting, the Tribal Court shall issue an order approving the distribution. (2) Closing of Estate. Once the estate is distributed, the Administrator shall file a statement with the Tribal Court stating that the estate is fully administered and ready to be closed, with receipts showing that the estate is fully distributed. Upon receipt of this statement, the estate shall be closed, the Administrator of the estate shall be dismissed, and if applicable, his/her bond shall be released. (f) Reopening an Estate . An estate may be reopened in the following circumstances: (1) Discovery of Will. If an estate has passed through probate on the assumption that a Will does not exist, but a Will is later discovered, the estate may be reopened so long as the petition to reopen is filed within sixty (60) days of discovery of the Will. An estate may only be reopened within two years of the final order closing the estate and only in extraordinary circumstances. In no instance may property be re-claimed by a newly identified heir if the property has been sold or transferred to a third party (bona fide purchaser). (2) Discovery of Property. If property is discovered after an estate has been closed, the estate may be reopened to dispose of the property. The Tribal Court shall order distribution of the property to the person or persons entitled thereto after issuing whatever orders are necessary to assure a just participation of the after-discovered property in the expenses of the estate.

An \"Interested Witness\" means any of the following: (A) an heir; (B) a beneficiary; (C) a person named as Executor; or (D) a person named as Executor in the Will of the deceased. (e) Self-Proved Will. (1) Self-Proved Will Generally. In order to be declared valid in court, the Will's beneficiaries will be required to bring forth evidence of the validity of the Will.

To simplify the process of proving a Will, the person making the Will may self-prove it at the time of execution or at a later time by signing an Acknowledgement of the Will statement. (2) Acknowledgement Form. The acknowledgement must be attached to the Will in form and content substantially as follows, shall be signed by the person making the Will and the witnesses, and then shall be notarized.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 12.02.170 Rules for Interpreting a Will (a) Incorporation by Reference . Any writing in existence when a Will is signed may be incorporated by reference if the Will indicates that the writing should be incorporated and it describes the writing sufficiently to permit its identification. (b) Rules of Construction and Intention . The intention of a person making a Will as expressed in his/her Will controls the distribution of the estate. The rules of construction set forth in this chapter do not apply if they are contrary to the intention of the Will. (c) Will Passes All Property . A Will must be interpreted to pass all property of the estate, including property acquired after the execution of the Will. (d) Devises or Gifts and the Residual. (1) Residue Definition. The \"residue\" of an estate is what remains after fees and expenses are paid and specific devises, or devises of assets or cash are made. This part of the estate is also call the \"residual.\" (2) Specific Devise. Wills may provide for specific shares of real or personal property to specific beneficiaries. This is known as a specific devise. If a specific devise cannot be carried out for any reason, such as the beneficiary has predeceased the person making the Will, whatever was devised becomes a part of the residue of the estate. (3) Division of Residue. If the person making the Will provides that the residue of the estate passes to two or more persons and one of the shares cannot be passed to that person, his/her share will pass to the other beneficiaries of the residue in proportion to their interests. (e) Property Given During Lifetime. (1) Generally. If a beneficiary is given a gift of property by the person making the Will during the Willmaker's lifetime, that property will be not be treated as satisfaction of a devise or gift under the Will except as provided for in subsection (2) below. (2) Treatment as Devise. The gift may be treated as part of the beneficiary's inheritance if (A) the Will provides for the deduction of the gift, (B) the person making the Will declares in a separate writing at the time of the gift that it is in satisfaction of a devise, or (C) the beneficiary acknowledges in writing that the gift is in satisfaction of a devise. (3) Valuation. If the property is determined to be a devise as set forth in subparagraph (e)(2) above then such property given during the lifetime of the Willmaker shall be valued at the date the beneficiary came into possession or enjoyment of the property. (f) Children Left Out of a Will . If a Willmaker mistakenly leaves a child out of his/her Will, or fails to provide for any children born or adopted after the Will is signed, the child who has been left out shall receive a share in the estate equal in value to that which he would have received had the person died without a Will. In satisfying a share provided for in this section, the other devises made by the Will shall be reduced according to the rules governing the distribution of an estate in Section 12.02.230(d) . A child who is excluded, however, shall not receive a share if it appears from the Will that the child was left out intentionally or the person making the Will expressed the intention to and did provide for the child outside of the Will. The burden of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence and it shall be on the excluded child seeking a share of the estate. (g) Spouse Left Out of a Will. (1) If a Will fails to provide for a surviving spouse, that spouse would not receive a share if it appears from the Will that the spouse was left out intentionally or the person making the Will otherwise expressed the intention to provide for, and did provide for, the surviving spouse outside of the Will. (2) If a Will fails to provide for a surviving spouse who married the person making the Will after the Will was signed, the spouse shall receive the same share of the estate the spouse would have received if the deceased left no Will. In satisfying a share provided for in this section, the other devises made by the Will shall be reduced according to the rules governing the distribution of an estate in Section 12.02.230(d) . (3) The burden of proof in either case shall be by a preponderance of the evidence and the burden shall be on the excluded spouse seeking a share in the estate. ( Res.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 12.02.180 Rules Applicable to the Revocation of a Will (a) Revocation Generally. (1) Later Will or Supplement. A Will or any part thereof may be revoked by a second (or later) valid Will, or a supplemental document (codicil) which has been signed and witnessed and is attached to a Will. In order for the prior Will to be revoked, the second Will (or later) or supplemental document must expressly state it is revoking a prior Will or the terms of the subsequent will or supplemental document are clearly inconsistent. In that case, the later Will or document takes precedence. (2) Destruction. A Will or any part thereof may be revoked by destroying, canceling, or obliterating the Will with the intent and for the purpose of revoking it. If unable to carry out the action, a person making a Will may direct any other person in his/her presence to destroy, cancel or obliterate the Will. (3) Revival. Once a Will is revoked, it cannot be revived unless, upon revocation of a second or later Will, the person making the Will declares his/her intention to revive the first Will or the circumstances clearly show the intention to revive it. (b) Revocation and Divorce or Separation. (1) Divorce. If, after executing a Will, the person making the Will is divorced or the marriage is annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any transfer of property made by the Will to the former spouse and that property will be distributed as if the spouse predeceased the person making the Will. Unless the Will expressly states otherwise, any provision naming the former spouse as Executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian is also revoked. If the person making the Will and the former spouse remarry, then, absent a preponderance of evidence of an intention to the contrary, the Will shall no longer be considered revoked by this section. (2) Separation. A decree of separation, which does not terminate the status of husband and wife, is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No other change of marital circumstances revokes a Will. ( Res.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 12.02.230 Executor Duties and Procedures (a) Preliminary Expenses. The Executor is required to pay for funeral expenses or any outstanding medical bills using the property of the estate, if available. The Executor is not required to pay any expenses out of pocket. (b) Inventory . (1) List of Assets. The Executor is required to take an inventory of all property and assets of the deceased. Assets may or may not include family heirlooms or items of sentimental value. This inventory is to be filed with Tribal Court within thirty (30) days after his/her appointment. The inventory should include an estimated value of all property and assets of the deceased. If an asset is of significant value, such as real property, an appraisal is recommended. The inventory should also indicate those items intended to be sold for the payment of debts or other estate requirements, if any. The Executor shall provide a copy of this inventory to all persons with a known interest in the estate at the same time it is filed with the Court. (2) Objection to Inventory. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the inventory, any person with an interest in the estate may file an objection to the inventory or to the sale of any item in the inventory. (3) Hearing and Court Review. If objections to the inventory are filed, the Tribal Court shall schedule a hearing to be held within thirty (30) days of date objections are filed. The Tribal Court shall notify all interested parties of the hearing. Upon consideration of the objections, the Tribal Court may order an amendment to the inventory or appraisal, or issue an order regarding the sale of property, as it deems just and proper to carry out the terms of the estate. (c) Creditors . (1) Identification. The Executor is required to identify all creditors of the estate. To do so, the Executor shall search the deceased's records for bills, notices, loan papers, and other documentation that suggests the deceased may have outstanding debts. The Executor has the duty to contact all known creditors to determine amounts owed and the process for addressing bills and other debts. The Executor shall also publish a public notice within thirty (30) days of appointment stating that all other creditors must present their claims to the Executor and that only the claims presented may be considered for payment by the estate. The notice shall give the creditors thirty (30) days to respond and will clearly state the final date for claims to be presented. Unless there is a waiver or modification approved by the Court, the notice shall be posted on the Tribe's website, and published for three consecutive weeks in a publication of general distribution on the Reservation and if deemed necessary in the nearby towns of Massena and Malone. (2) Documentation. For those debts identified by the Executor from the estate records, the Executor shall prepare a list of the amounts owed and any necessary forms or documentation needed to resolve the debts and close accounts. Any other claims submitted by a creditor shall state under oath that his claim is justly due, that to the extent payments were made by the deceased they have been credited, and that he/she knows of no offsets against the claim. If a creditor fails to present a claim within the time period allowed, the creditor may request that the Tribal Court in its discretion allow him/her to file the claim directly with the Tribal Court at the same as the Executor presents the creditors' claims under subsection (4) below. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied. (3) Executor Review. Once the Executor collects the creditors' claims, the Executor will review them and will notify the creditors as to whether they are accepted or rejected and explain the reasons for the decision. The Executor is required to make a decision and provide notice within thirty (30) days of presentation of the claim. (4) Court Review. (A) The Executor shall notify the Tribal Court as to whether any creditor claims have been presented. (B) If there are claims, the Executor shall provide the Tribal Court with a list of claims with supporting documentation explaining whether the claim has been accepted or rejected. The Executor must present this information to the Court no later than forty-five (45) days after the creditor claim period has closed. (C) Rejected creditors have ten (10) days to respond to the list filed with the Court. If after ten (10) days, no objections are filed, the Court may approve the list and the Executor may pay the approved claims. If a rejected creditor files an objection, the Tribal Court shall determine the validity of the claim and the objection, relying on the affidavit or personal testimony of the claimant. An order regarding a creditor's claim may be appealed. If an objection or appeal is filed, the Administrator may pay creditors only after the Tribal Court issues an order regarding the validity of the claims. At no time, shall the Tribal Court permit the sale of Tribal Land to satisfy an estate's debts except if the claimant can show that the deceased expected his/her land to be sold to satisfy the outstanding debt. (5) Timing In sum, the time frame for the Executor as set forth in this chapter is as follows: (A) Inventory. Within thirty (30) days after appointment, the Executor will present an estate inventory to the Court. Objections to the inventory are to be filed with the court no later than thirty (30) days thereafter. If objections are filed, the court must hold a hearing within thirty (30) days. (B) Creditor's Claims. Within thirty (30) days after appointment, the Executor must publish a public notice asking for creditors to bring forth their claims. A Creditor will have thirty (30) days from the date of the last public notice to file a claim with the Administrator. The Executor will have thirty (30) days from the filing of the claim to decide whether to recognize the creditor's claim. If claims are filed or debts are identified, the Executor must file a list of claims with the Court within forty-five (45) days after the claim period closes. Rejected creditors have ten (10) days to file with the Court documentation explaining why they should be paid. (d) Insufficient Estate and Reduction of Shares. (1) Priority. If there are not enough assets in the deceased's estate to make a full distribution of property under the Will, beneficiary shares shall be reduced, without any preference or priority as between real and personal property, as follows: (1) shares that may be inherited through the application of the rules for distribution without a Will are reduced first; (2) shares that may be inherited though the residual provision of a Will are reduced second, and (3) only then are specific devises under the Will reduced. (2) Proportion. The reduction of the shares is in proportion to the amount of property each of the beneficiaries would have received if a full distribution of the property had been made in accordance with the terms of the Will. (3) Specific Devise. If the estate is so insufficient that the subject of a specific devise is sold or used as part of estate administration, the remaining shares shall be adjusted to reflect the contribution of the specific devise. (e) Distribution of Estate. The Executor is responsible for distributing the estate once beneficiaries are identified and the creditors, if any, have been identified. (1) Creditors. All verified claims of creditors allowed by the Tribal Court shall be paid before distribution of the estate to the heirs. (2) Accounting. Before distributing the estate to the beneficiaries, the Executor must provide the Tribal Court with an accounting of the estate for approval. The accounting will show all disbursements made for expenses and creditors, and shall include receipts. The accounting will also show the computation of any attorney's and/or Executor's fees for which approval is sought. The accounting will set out the remaining estate to be distributed and contain a statement that the estate is ready to be distributed to the beneficiaries. The accounting may include a signed consent form from each beneficiary to the proposed distribution from the estate. (3) Advances. When distributing property among the beneficiaries, any property that was advanced is valued at the time the beneficiary came into possession of the property. (4) Executor Fee. If an Executor requests a fee, the Tribal Court shall establish the percentage for compensation on a case by case basis, but in no event shall the percentage be more than five (5%) percent of the total value of the gross estate (f) Order Approving Distribution and Closing of Estate. (1) Order of Distribution. When the Tribal Court is satisfied that an estate is ready to be distributed and the Executor has set out the plan for distribution in the accounting, the Tribal Court shall issue an order approving the distribution. (2) Closing of Estate. Once the estate is distributed, the Executor shall file a statement with the Tribal Court stating that the estate is fully administered and ready to be closed and submit receipts showing that the estate is fully distributed. Upon receipt of this statement, the estate shall be closed, the Executor of the estate shall be dismissed, and if applicable, any bond shall be released. (g) Reopening an Estate . If property is discovered after an estate has been closed, the estate may be reopened to dispose of the property. The Tribal Court shall order distribution of the property to the person or persons entitled thereto after issuing whatever orders are necessary to assure a just participation of the after-discovered property in the expenses of the estate.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 15.01.030 Definitions (a) The following terms and phrases used in this chapter are arranged in alphabetical order. More detailed definitions of some technical terms are contained in the USDA Final Rule, Subchapter A which is adopted and incorporated by reference in this chapter . (1) \"Acceptable hemp THC level\" is when the application of the measurement of uncertainty to the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis produces a distribution or range that includes 0.3% or less. For example, if the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis is 0.35% and the measurement of uncertainty is +/- 0.06%, the measured delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis for this sample ranges from 0.29% to 0.41%. Because 0.3% is within the distribution or range, the sample is within the acceptable hemp THC level for plan compliance. This definition of \"acceptable hemp THC level\" affects neither the statutory definition of hemp, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639o (1), in the 2018 Farm Bill nor the definition of \"marihuana,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(16), in the CSA. (2) \"Agricultural Marketing Service\" or \"AMS\" means the Agricultural Marketing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (3) \"Cannabis\" means a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae of which Cannabissativais a species, and Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis are subspecies thereof. Cannabis refers to any form of the plant in which the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration on a dry weight basis has not yet been determined. (4) \"Conviction\" means any plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or any finding of guilt, except when the finding of guilt is subsequently overturned on appeal, pardoned, or expunged. For purposes of this chapter , a conviction is expunged when the conviction is removed from the individual's criminal history record and there are no legal disabilities or restrictions associated with the expunged conviction, other than the fact that the conviction may be used for sentencing purposes for subsequent convictions. In addition, where an individual is allowed to withdraw an original plea of guilty or nolo contendere and enter a plea of not guilty and the case is subsequently dismissed, the individual is no longer considered to have a conviction. (5) \"Corrective action plan\" means a plan established by the Tribe for a licensed hemp producer to correct a negligent violation or non-compliance. (6) \"Criminal History Report\" means the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Identity History Summary. (7) \"Culpable mental state greater than negligence\" means to act intentionally, knowingly, willfully, or recklessly. (8) \"Decarboxylated\" means the completion of the chemical reaction that converts THC-acid (THC-A) into delta-9-THC, the intoxicating component of cannabis. The decarboxylated value is also calculated using a conversion formula that sums delta-9-THC and eighty-seven and seven tenths (87.7) percent of THC-acid. (9) \"Decarboxylation\" means the removal or elimination of carboxyl group from a molecule or organic compound. (10) \"Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol\" or \"THC\" is the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. For the purposes of this part, delta-9 THC and THC are interchangeable. (11) \"Disposal\" means an activity that transitions a non-compliant product into a non-retrievable or non-ingestible form. Such activities include plowing, tilling, or disking plant material into the soil; mulching, composting, chopping, or bush mowing plant material into green manure; burning plant material; burying plant material into the earth and covering with soil. (12) \"Drug Enforcement Administration\" or \"DEA\" means the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. (13) \"Dry weight basis\" means the ratio of the amount of moisture in a sample to the amount of dry solid in a sample. A basis for expressing the percentage of a chemical in a substance after removing the moisture from the substance. Percentage of THC on a dry weight basis means the percentage of THC, by weight, in a cannabis item (plant, extract, or other derivative), after excluding moisture from the item. (14) \"Entity\" means a corporation, joint stock company, association, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, irrevocable trust, estate, charitable organization, or other similar organization, including any such organization participating in the hemp production as a partner in a general partnership, a participant in a joint venture, or a participant in a similar organization. (15) \"Farm Service Agency\" or \"FSA\" is an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. (16) \"Gas chromatography\" or \"GC\" means a type of chromatography in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. GC relies on heat for separating and analyzing compounds that can be vaporized without decomposition. (17) \"Geospatial location\" means a location designated through a global system of navigational satellites used to determine the precise ground position of a place or object. (18) \"Hemp\" means the plant species Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. (19) \"High-performance liquid chromatography\" or \"HPLC\" is a type of chromatography technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. HPLC relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material to separate and analyze compounds. (20) \"Key participants\" means a sole proprietor, a partner in partnership, or a person with executive managerial control in a corporation. A person with executive managerial control includes persons such as a chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. This definition does not include non-executive managers such as farm, field, or shift managers. (21) \"Law enforcement agency\" refers to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Police Department or, in some circumstances, a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency. (22) \"Lot\" means a contiguous area in a field, greenhouse, or indoor growing structure containing the same variety or strain of cannabis throughout the area. The term lot also means the terms \"farm,\" \"tract,\" \"field,\" and \"subfield\" as these are terms are used by FSA in 7 CFR 718.2 to define lot. (23) \"Marijuana\" or \"marihuana\" means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. The term 'marihuana' does not include hemp, as defined in section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 and does not include the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination (7 U.S.C. 1639o). \"Marihuana\" means all cannabis that tests as having a concentration level of THC on a dry weight basis of higher than 0.3 percent. (24) \"Measurement of Uncertainty (MU)\" is the parameter, associated with the result of a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the quantity subject to measurement. (25) \"Negligence\" means the failure to exercise the level of care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in complying with this chapter . (26) \"Post decarboxylation\" means a value determined after the process of decarboxylation that determines the total potential delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content derived from the sum of the THC and THC-A content and reported on a dry weight basis. The post decarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The post decarboxylation value of THC can also be calculated by using a high-performance liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THC-A intact, and requires a conversion calculation of that THC-A to calculate total potential THC in a given sample. (27) \"Produce\" means to grow hemp plants for market, or for cultivation for market, in the United States. For purposes of this chapter it also includes, but is not limited to, cultivation, extraction, obtaining seeds, handling hemp, storage, transportation and shipment of hemp to market. (28) \"Remediation\" refers to the process of rendering non-compliant cannabis, compliant. Remediation can occur by removing and destroying flower material, while retaining stalk, stems, leaf material, and seeds. Remediation can also occur by shredding the entire plant into a biomass like material, then re-testing the shredded biomass material for compliance. (29) \"Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe\" or \"Tribe\" means the federally recognized Indian Tribe, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe with government offices in Akwesasne, New York. (30) \"Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Police\" means the law enforcement department for the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe with police authority over Tribal Territory. (31) \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (32) \"Total THC\" is the value determined after the process of decarboxylation, or the application of a conversion factor if the testing methodology does not include decarboxylation, that expresses the potential total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content derived from the sum of the THC and THCA content and reported on a dry weight basis. This post-decarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, such as gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The total THC can also be calculated by using a liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THCA intact. This technique requires the use of the following conversion: [Total THC = (0.877 x THCA) + THC] which calculates the potential total THC in a given sample. (33) \"Tribal Member\" or \"Mohawk Tribal Member\" means a person who is enrolled in the Tribe under the Tribe's Membership Code or a person who is eligible to be enrolled regardless of where they reside. (34) \"Tribal Member-Owned Business\" or \"Tribal Member Business\" means an entity that is more than fifty percent (50%) owned and controlled by a Tribal Member. \"Controlled\" means to have controlling interest whereby a person holds a majority of a company's voting stock, giving them significant influence over any corporate actions. A person or group of persons having a controlling interest will be able to direct the course of a company and make strategic and operational decisions. (35) \"Tribal Territory\" or \"Mohawk Tribal Territory\" means all lands within the 1796 Treaty with the Seven Nations of Canada (97 Stat. 55) and includes any other lands over which the Tribe exercises jurisdiction. It also includes rights-of-way running through the 1796 Reservation; and any land title to which is either held in trust by the United States for the benefit the Tribe or individual or held by the Tribe or individual subject to restriction by the United States against alienation and over which the Tribe exercises jurisdiction.

It contains mandatory rules on sales to minors. And it includes provisions protecting community health and safety at least as robust as those imposed by New York State with respect to AUC sales.

{"body": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Code of Law. 16.05.100 Service of Process on Managers and Liquidating Trustees (a) A manager or a liquidating trustee of a limited liability company may be served with process in the manner prescribed in this section in all civil actions or proceedings brought within the Reservation involving or relating to the business of the limited liability company or a violation by the manager or the liquidating trustee of a duty to the limited liability company, or any member of the limited liability company, whether or not the manager or the liquidating trustee is a manager or a liquidating trustee at the time suit is commenced. A manager's or a liquidating trustee's serving as such constitutes such person's consent to the appointment of the registered agent of the limited liability company (or, if there is none, the Secretary) as such person's agent upon whom service of process may be made as provided in this section . Such service as a manager or a liquidating trustee shall signify the consent of such manager or liquidating trustee that any process when so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon such manager or liquidating trustee within the Reservation and such appointment of the registered agent (or, if there is none, the Secretary) shall be irrevocable. As used in this subsection (a) and in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section , the term \"manager\" refers (i) to a person who is a manager as defined in Section 16.05.020(j) of this chapter and (ii) to a person, whether or not a member of a limited liability company, who, although not a manager as defined in Section 16.05.020(j) of this chapter , participates materially in the management of the limited liability company; provided however, that the power to elect or otherwise select or to participate in the election or selection of a person to be a manager as defined in Section 16.05.020(j) of this chapter shall not, by itself, constitute participation in the management of the limited liability company. (b) Service of process shall be effected by serving the registered agent (or, if there is none, the Secretary) with 1 copy of such process in the manner provided by law of the Tribe for service of writs of summons or, if there is no manner provided by law of the Tribe for service of a writ of summons, then by registered United States mail. In the event service is made under this subsection upon the Secretary, the plaintiff shall pay to the Secretary the sum of $50 for the use of the Tribe, which sum shall be taxed as part of the costs of the proceeding if the plaintiff shall prevail therein. In addition, the Tribal Court Clerk in which the civil action or proceeding is pending shall, within 7 days of such service, deposit in the United States mails, by registered mail, postage prepaid, true and attested copies of the process, together with a statement that service is being made pursuant to this section , addressed to such manager or liquidating trustee at the registered office of the limited liability company and at the manager's or liquidating trustee's address last known to the party desiring to make such service. (c) In any action in which any such manager or liquidating trustee has been served with process as hereinabove provided, the time in which a defendant shall be required to appear and file a responsive pleading shall be computed from the date of mailing by the Tribal Court Clerk as provided in subsection (b) of this section ; however, the Tribal Court in which such action has been commenced may order such continuance or continuances as may be necessary to afford such manager or liquidating trustee reasonable opportunity to defend the action. (d) (1) Subject to paragraph 2 of this subsection, in a written limited liability company agreement or other writing, a manager or member must, at a minimum, consent to be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribal Court and may, in addition, consent to be subject to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or arbitration in, a specified jurisdiction, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribal Court, or the exclusivity of arbitration in a specified jurisdiction or within the Reservation, and to be served with legal process in the manner prescribed in such limited liability company agreement or other writing. Except by agreeing to arbitrate any arbitrable matter in a specified jurisdiction or within the Reservation, a member who is not a manager may not waive its right to maintain a legal action or proceeding in the Tribal Court with respect to matters relating to the organization or internal affairs of a limited liability company. (1) Paragraph 1 of this subsection does not apply to any limited liability company in which the Tribe, Te W\u00e0 Tha H\u00f3n:Ni Corporation, or an instrumentality of the Tribe or wholly-owned entity of the Tribe is a member. As to such limited liability companies, in a written limited liability company agreement or other writing, a manager or member must, at a minimum, consent to be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribal Court and may, in addition, consent to be subject to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or arbitration in, a specified jurisdiction, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribal Court, or the exclusivity of arbitration in a specified jurisdiction or within the Reservation, and to be served with legal process in the manner prescribed in such limited liability company agreement or other writing, but only as to suits or to arbitration between or among the limited liability company, its members, and/or the Tribe, and not as to any third parties. Any such limited liability company, or a member of such limited liability company that is the Tribe, Te W\u00e0 Tha H\u00f3n:Ni Corporation, or an instrumentality of the Tribe or wholly-owned entity of the Tribe, may consent to suit by third parties pursuant to Section 16.05.310(c) of this chapter . (e) Nothing herein contained limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner now or hereafter provided by law. This section is an extension of and not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal process upon nonresidents.

A person who executes a certificate as an agent or fiduciary need not exhibit evidence of that person's authority as a prerequisite to filing. Any signature on any certificate authorized to be filed with the Secretary under any provision of this chapter may be a facsimile, a conformed signature or an electronically transmitted signature. Unless the Secretary finds that any certificate does not conform to law, upon receipt of all filing fees required by law, the Secretary shall: (1) Certify that the certificate of formation, the certificate of amendment, the certificate of correction, the certificate of amendment of a certificate with a future effective date or time, the certificate of termination of a certificate with a future effective date or time, the certificate of cancellation (or of any judicial decree of amendment or cancellation), the certificate of merger or consolidation, the restated certificate, the corrected certificate, the certificate of conversion to limited liability company, the certificate of transfer, the certificate of transfer and continuance, or the certificate of revival has been filed in the Secretary's office by endorsing upon the signed certificate the word \"Filed\" and the date and time of the filing. This endorsement is conclusive of the date and time of its filing in the absence of actual fraud. Except as provided in subdivision (a)(5) or (a)(6) of this section , such date and time of filing of a certificate shall be the date and time of delivery of the certificate; (2) File and index the endorsed certificate; (3) Prepare and return to the person who filed it or that person's representative a copy of the signed certificate, similarly endorsed, and shall certify such copy as a true copy of the signed certificate; and (4) Cause to be entered such information from the certificate as the Secretary deems appropriate into the Tribal Corporation Information System or any system which is a successor thereto in the office of the Secretary, and such information and a copy of such certificate shall be permanently maintained as a public record on a suitable medium. The Secretary is authorized to grant direct access to such system to registered agents subject to the execution of an operating agreement between the Secretary and such registered agent. Any registered agent granted such access shall demonstrate the existence of policies to ensure that information entered into the system accurately reflects the content of certificates in the possession of the registered agent at the time of entry. (5) Upon request made upon or prior to delivery, the Secretary may, to the extent deemed practicable, establish as the date and time of filing of a certificate a date and time after its delivery. If the Secretary refuses to file any certificate due to an error, omission or other imperfection, the Secretary may hold such certificate in suspension, and in such event, upon delivery of a replacement certificate in proper form for filing and tender of the required fees within 5 business days after notice of such suspension is given to the filer, the Secretary shall establish as the date and time of filing of such certificate the date and time that would have been the date and time of filing of the rejected certificate had it been accepted for filing. The Secretary shall not issue a certificate of good standing with respect to any limited liability company with a certificate held in suspension pursuant to this subsection. The Secretary may establish as the date and time of filing of a certificate the date and time at which information from such certificate is entered pursuant to subdivision (a)(4) of this section if such certificate is delivered on the same date and within 4 hours after such information is entered. (6) If: (A) Together with the actual delivery of a certificate and tender of the required fees, there is delivered to the Secretary a separate affidavit (which in its heading shall be designated as an affidavit of extraordinary condition) attesting, on the basis of personal knowledge of the affiant or a reliable source of knowledge identified in the affidavit, that an earlier effort to deliver such certificate and tender such fees was made in good faith, specifying the nature, date and time of such good faith effort and requesting that the Secretary establish such date and time as the date and time of filing of such certificate; or (B) Upon the actual delivery of a certificate and tender of the required fees, the Secretary in the Secretary's own discretion provides a written waiver of the requirement for such an affidavit stating that it appears to the Secretary that an earlier effort to deliver such certificate and tender such fees was made in good faith and specifying the date and time of such effort; and (C) The Secretary determines that an extraordinary condition existed at such date and time, that such earlier effort was unsuccessful as a result of the existence of such extraordinary condition, and that such actual delivery and tender were made within a reasonable period (not to exceed 2 business days) after the cessation of such extraordinary condition, then the Secretary may establish such date and time as the date and time of filing of such certificate. No fee shall be paid to the Secretary for receiving an affidavit of extraordinary condition. For purposes of this subsection, an extraordinary condition means: any emergency resulting from an attack on, invasion or occupation by foreign military forces of, or disaster, catastrophe, war or other armed conflict, revolution or insurrection or rioting or civil commotion in, the United States or a locality in which the Secretary conducts its business or in which the good faith effort to deliver the certificate and tender the required fees is made, or the immediate threat of any of the foregoing; or any malfunction or outage of the electrical or telephone service to the Secretary's office, or weather or other condition in or about a locality in which the Secretary conducts its business, as a result of which the Secretary's office is not open for the purpose of the filing of certificates under this chapter or such filing cannot be effected without extraordinary effort. The Secretary may require such proof as it deems necessary to make the determination required under this subparagraph of subdivision (a)(6), and any such determination shall be conclusive in the absence of actual fraud. If the Secretary establishes the date and time of filing of a certificate pursuant to this subsection, the date and time of delivery of the affidavit of extraordinary condition or the date and time of the Secretary's written waiver of such affidavit shall be endorsed on such affidavit or waiver and such affidavit or waiver, so endorsed, shall be attached to the filed certificate to which it relates. Such filed certificate shall be effective as of the date and time established as the date and time of filing by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection, except as to those persons who are substantially and adversely affected by such establishment and, as to those persons, the certificate shall be effective from the date and time endorsed on the affidavit of extraordinary condition or written waiver attached thereto. (b) Upon the filing of a certificate of amendment (or judicial decree of amendment), certificate of correction, corrected certificate or restated certificate in the office of the Secretary, or upon the future effective date or time of a certificate of amendment (or judicial decree thereof) or restated certificate, as provided for therein, the certificate of formation shall be amended, corrected or restated as set forth therein. Upon the filing of a certificate of cancellation (or a judicial decree thereof), or a certificate of merger or consolidation which acts as a certificate of cancellation or a certificate of transfer, or upon the future effective date or time of a certificate of cancellation (or a judicial decree thereof) or of a certificate of merger or consolidation which acts as a certificate of cancellation or a certificate of transfer, the certificate of formation is cancelled. Upon the filing of a certificate of conversion to limited liability company or upon the future effective date or time of a certificate of conversion to limited liability company, the entity filing the certificate of conversion to limited liability company is converted to a limited liability company. Upon the filing of a certificate of revival, the limited liability company is revived. (c) If any certificate filed in accordance with this chapter provides for a future effective date or time and if, prior to such future effective date or time set forth in such certificate, the transaction is terminated or its terms are amended to change the future effective date or time or any other matter described in such certificate so as to make such certificate false or inaccurate in any respect, such certificate shall, prior to the future effective date or time set forth in such certificate, be terminated or amended by the filing of a certificate of termination or certificate of amendment of such certificate, executed in accordance with Section 16.05.160 of this chapter , which shall identify the certificate which has been terminated or amended and shall state that the certificate has been terminated or the manner in which it has been amended. Upon the filing of a certificate of amendment of a certificate with a future effective date or time, the certificate identified in such certificate of amendment is amended. Upon the filing of a certificate of termination of a certificate with a future effective date or time, the certificate identified in such certificate of termination is terminated.

A certificate of merger that sets forth any amendment in accordance with subsection (c)(4) of this section shall be deemed to be an amendment to the certificate of formation of the limited liability company, and the limited liability company shall not be required to take any further action to amend its certificate of formation under Section 16.05.140 of this chapter with respect to such amendments set forth in the certificate of merger. Whenever this section requires the filing of a certificate of merger or consolidation, such requirement shall be deemed satisfied by the filing of an agreement of merger or consolidation containing the information required by this section to be set forth in the certificate of merger or consolidation. (f) An agreement of merger or consolidation approved in accordance with subsection (b) of this section may: (1) Effect any amendment to the limited liability company agreement; or (2) Effect the adoption of a new limited liability company agreement, for a limited liability company if it is the surviving or resulting limited liability company in the merger or consolidation. Any amendment to a limited liability company agreement or adoption of a new limited liability company agreement made pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or consolidation. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit the accomplishment of a merger or of any of the matters referred to herein by any other means provided for in a limited liability company agreement or other agreement or as otherwise permitted by law, including that the limited liability company agreement of any constituent limited liability company to the merger or consolidation (including a limited liability company formed for the purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation) shall be the limited liability company agreement of the surviving or resulting limited liability company. (g) When any merger or consolidation shall have become effective under this section , for all purposes of the laws of the Tribe, all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the domestic limited liability companies and other business entities that have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to any of said domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, shall be vested in the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity, and shall thereafter be the property of the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity as they were of each of the domestic limited liability companies and other business entities that have merged or consolidated, and the ordinance to any real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the Tribe, in any of such domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of this chapter ; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any of said domestic limited liability companies and other business entities shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the said domestic limited liability companies and other business entities that have merged or consolidated shall thenceforth attach to the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it. Unless otherwise agreed, a merger or consolidation of a domestic limited liability company, including a domestic limited liability company which is not the surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation, shall not require such domestic limited liability company to wind up its affairs under Section 16.05.610 of this chapter or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets under Section 16.05.620 of this chapter .

If a member does not make the required contribution of property or services, the member is obligated at the option of the limited liability company to contribute cash equal to that portion of the agreed value (as stated in the records of the limited liability company) of the contribution that has not been made. The foregoing option shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights, including the right to specific performance, that the limited liability company may have against such member under the limited liability company agreement or applicable law.

Notwithstanding the compromise, a creditor of a limited liability company who extends credit, after the entering into of a limited liability company agreement or an amendment thereto which, in either case, reflects the obligation, and before the amendment thereof to reflect the compromise, may enforce the original obligation to the extent that, in extending credit, the creditor reasonably relied on the obligation of a member to make a contribution or return. A conditional obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property to a limited liability company may not be enforced unless the conditions of the obligation have been satisfied or waived as to or by such member. Conditional obligations include contributions payable upon a discretionary call of a limited liability company prior to the time the call occurs. (c) A limited liability company agreement may provide that the interest of any member who fails to make any contribution that the member is obligated to make shall be subject to specified penalties for, or specified consequences of, such failure. Such penalty or consequence may take the form of reducing or eliminating the defaulting member's proportionate interest in a limited liability company, subordinating the member's limited liability company interest to that of nondefaulting members, a forced sale of that limited liability company interest, forfeiture of the defaulting member's limited liability company interest, the lending by other members of the amount necessary to meet the defaulting member's commitment, a fixing of the value of the defaulting member's limited liability company interest by appraisal or by formula and redemption or sale of the limited liability company interest at such value, or other penalty or consequence.

B. When filing to modify a joint custody order, Subsection 02.370.A does not apply if: 1. the other parent consents to the residence change and the Tribal Court enters an order permitting the residence change; 2. after complying with paragraph C below, the Tribal Court permits the residence change; 3. after a hearing, the Tribal Court determines to grant sole legal custody and sole physical custody to one (1) of the parents; or 4. the modified order would result in the child's two (2) legal residences being closer to each other.

D. Each Tribal Court order determining or amending custody or parenting time of any child shall include a provision stating each parent's agreement as to how a change in either of the child's legal residences will be handled. If such a provision is included in the order and the child's legal residence change is done in compliance with that provision, this paragraph shall not apply. If the Parents do not agree on such a provision, the Tribal Court shall include in the order the following provision: \"A parent whose custody or parenting time of a child is governed by this order shall not change the legal residence of the child except in compliance with this Chapter .\" E.

Upon a parent's return from active military duty, the Tribal Court shall reinstate the custody order in effect immediately before that period of active military duty. If a motion for change of custody is filed after a parent returns from active military duty, the Tribal Court shall not consider a parent's absence due to that military duty in a best interests of the child determination.

(d) This Ordinance includes appropriate fees on commercial AUC activities to fund tribal oversight and regulation and to fund tribal member programs and services. Section 1.03.

SAINT REGIS MOHAWK TRIBAL COUNCIL _____________________ _____________________ _____________________ Beverly Cook Michael Conners Ron LaFrance, Jr. Tribal Chief Tribal Chief Tribal Chief CERTIFICATION : This is to certify that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council pursuant to the authority vested therein duly passed the above resolution. ___________________________________ February 1, 2022 Summer Bero, Tribal Clerk Date Water Quality Standards for the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Under the Authority of the Clean Water Act \u00a7303(c) Section I. Purpose, Authority, Applicability And Implementation The Tribal Council of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, a federally - recognized Tribe of Indians, hereby enacts the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Water Quality Standards. A. Purpose . The purpose of the Tribe's Water Quality Standards is as follows: 1. Assign designated uses for which Tribal Surface Waters shall be protected; 2. Prescribe and impose water quality standards (narrative and numeric) in order to sustain the designated use of Tribal Surface Waters; 3. Protect against the degradation of Tribal Surface Waters; 4. Promote the social welfare and economic well-being of the Tribe; 5. Promote a holistic watershed approach to management of the Tribal Surface Waters; 6. Provide for the protection of threatened or endangered species and, 7. Protect cultural and ceremonial uses. The purpose of these water quality standards is to facilitate sovereign self-determination and the restoration and preservation of traditional hunting, fishing, gathering and cultural uses in, on and around Tribal Surface Waters. The Environment Division is committed to providing cleaner, safer water for all of creation. These water quality standards will in turn promote the general welfare and well-being of the community by allowing the Tribe and its members to utilize the water for traditional, cultural and ceremonial purposes. Water quality standards are not used to control, and are not invalidated by, natural background phenomena or acts of the Creator. These purposes shall be accomplished by utilizing the standards set forth in the Tribe's Water Quality Standards as the basis for permitting and management process for point source discharges and nonpoint source generators, by using treatment technologies to control point sources and by adopting best management practices for nonpoint sources of pollution. B. Authority . The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe maintains the plenary sovereign power to regulate the quality of Tribal Surface Waters in the interest of the health and wellbeing of the Mohawk People. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7303 and 518 of the Clean Water Act the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved the Tribe's Application for a Determination of Eligibility to Administer Programs under the Clean Water Act on October 16, 2002. C. Applicability . The Tribal Water Quality Standards apply to all Tribal Surface Waters, that is, all surface waters within the exterior boundaries of the Saint Regis Mohawk Territory, including water situated wholly or partly within, or bordering upon, the Territory, whether public or private, except for private waters that do not combine with other surface waters. D. Implementation . 1. Water Resources Personnel. The Water Resources Program shall administer the SRMT WQS. The program is comprised of a Program Manager and Technicians. This program shall serve under the direction of the Director of the SRMT Environment Division. 2. Consistency. The Tribe's Water Quality Standards are consistent with section 101(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251(a)(2)), which declares that \"it is the national goal that, wherever attainable, an interim goal of water quality which provides for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and provides for recreation in and on the water achieved by July, 1983....\" Primary contact and ceremonial use, agricultural and water supply use are other designated uses of Tribal Surface Waters. The Tribe's Water Quality Standards provide that such designated uses shall not result in any contamination that may lower the quality of the water below what is required for recreation and protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife. 3. Antidegradation Policy. The antidegradation policy for Tribal Surface Waters and the procedures for implementing it are set forth in Section III and in the Implementation Plan. 4. Revisions. The Tribal Water Quality Standards will be reviewed every 3 years. The review provides an opportunity for revisions and/or additions based on new information or for clarification of existing issues. 5. Public hearings. Following enactment, pursuant to Section 303(c)(1) of the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. Section 303(c)], the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe shall hold public hearings at least once every three years for the purpose of reviewing and, as appropriate, amending the Tribal Water Quality Standards. Findings and revisions shall incorporate relevant scientific and engineering advances as well as any other relevant environmental concerns. 6. Protection of Designated Uses. Conditions particular to a use shall be protected at all times. General Conditions ( Section IV , below) shall be maintained at all times and shall apply to all Tribal Surface Waters, whether perennial, ephemeral, or intermittent. The standards assigned to each Tribal Surface Water shall be the most stringent standards required to protect all uses designated for that body of water. 7. Use Attainability. In the event that monitoring of water quality identifies reaches where attainable water quality is less than what is required by the Tribal Water Quality Standards, then the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe may modify the Water Quality Standards to reflect attainability. Modification shall then be within the sole discretion of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, but shall be subject to the provisions of the Clean Water Act, and shall be carried out in accordance with use-attainability analysis procedures required by 40 CFR 131.10. A designated use, that is not an existing use, may be removed if it is demonstrated that attaining the designated use is infeasible. Further, at a minimum, uses are considered attainable if they can be achieved by implementing effluent limits required under Sections 301(b) and 306 of the Clean Water Act (Act) and by implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management practices (BMPs) for nonpoint source control. (40 CFR 131.10(h)(2)). If the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe adopts a new or revised water quality standard based on a required use attainability analysis, the Tribe shall also adopt the highest attainable use, as defined in \u00a7131.3(m). A Use Attainability Analysis must be conducted whenever: (1) The Tribe designates or has designated uses that do not include the uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act, or (2) The Tribe wishes to remove a designated use that is specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act or to adopt subcategories of uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act which require less stringent criteria. The regulation (at 40 CFR 131.10(g)) specifies that States and Tribes may remove a designated use which is not an existing use if attainment of a use is not feasible due to the following: a. Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the attainment of a use; or, b. Natural, ephemeral, intermittent, or low flow conditions or water levels prevent the attainment of the use, unless these conditions may be compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent discharges without violating State or Tribal water conservation requirements to enable uses to be met; or, c. Human caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the attainment of the use and cannot be remedied or would cause more environmental damage to correct than to leave in place; or; d. Dams, diversions or other types of hydrological modifications preclude the attainment of the use, and it is not feasible to restore the water body to its original condition or operate such modification in a way that would result in the attainment of a use; or, e. Physical conditions related to the natural features of the water body, such as the lack of a proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the like, unrelated to water quality, preclude attainment of aquatic life protection uses; or, f. Controls more stringent than those required by Sections 301(b) and 306 of the Act would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact. Section II.

Antidegradation Policy And Implementation Procedures, Mixing Zones, And Allowance For Compliance Schedules A. Antidegradation Policy: This antidegradation standard shall be applicable to any action or activity by any source, point or nonpoint, of pollutants that is anticipated to result in an increased loading of pollutants to Tribal surface waters. Pursuant to this standard: 1. Existing instream water uses, as defined herein, and the level of water quality necessary to protect existing uses shall be maintained and protected. Where designated uses of the water body are impaired, there shall be no lowering of the water quality with respect to the pollutant or pollutants which are causing the impairment; 2. Where, for any parameter, the quality of the waters exceed levels necessary to support the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the waters, that water shall be considered high quality for that parameter consistent with the definition of high quality water found at Section B.1.B of this antidegradation standard and that quality shall be maintained and protected unless the Tribe finds, after full satisfaction of Tribe's intergovernmental coordination and public participation provisions of the Tribe's continuing planning process, that allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation, the Tribe shall assure water quality adequate to fully protect existing uses. Further, the Tribe shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and existing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. The Tribe shall utilize the Antidegradation Implementation Procedures set forth below in determining if any lowering of water quality will be allowed; i The Tribe identifies waters for the protections described in paragraph ( A )(2) of this section on a parameter-by-parameter basis. ii Before allowing any lowering of high water quality, pursuant to paragraph ( A )(2) of this section, the Tribe shall find, after an analysis of alternatives, that such a lowering is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the area in which the waters are located. The analysis of alternatives shall evaluate a range of practicable alternatives that would prevent or lessen the degradation associated with the proposed activity. When the analysis of alternatives identifies one or more practicable alternatives, the Tribe shall only find that a lowering is necessary if one such alternative is selected for implementation. 3. Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding national or tribal resource, such as waters of national and State parks and wildlife refuges and waters of exceptional recreational, religious or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected; and 4. In those cases where the potential lowering of water quality is associated with a thermal discharge, the decision to allow such degradation shall be consistent with Section 316 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). (b) As described in Section B. below, the Tribe has developed methods for implementing the antidegradation policy that are, at a minimum, consistent with the Tribe's policy and with paragraph ( A ) of this section. The Tribe shall provide an opportunity for public involvement during the development and any subsequent revisions of the implementation methods, and shall make the methods available to the public. B. Antidegradation Implementation Procedures: 1. Definitions. a. Control Document. Any authorization issued by a State, Tribal or Federal agency to any source of pollutants to waters under its jurisdiction that specifies conditions under which the source is allowed to operate. b. High quality waters. High quality waters are water bodies in which, on a parameter by parameter basis, the quality of the waters exceeds levels necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water. c. Outstanding Resource Waters. Those waters designated as such by the Tribe. The Waters that may be considered for designation as Outstanding Resource Waters include, but are not limited to, water bodies that are recognized as: (i) Important because of protection through official action, such as Tribal, Federal or State law, Presidential or secretarial action, international treaty, or interstate compact; (ii) Having exceptional recreational significance; (iii) Having exceptional ecological significance; (iv) Having other special environmental, recreational, religious or ecological attributes; or waters whose designation as Outstanding Resource Waters is reasonably necessary for the protection of other waters so designated. d. Significant Lowering of Water Quality. A significant lowering of water quality occurs when there is a new or increased loading of any Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics (PBT) from any regulated existing or new facility, either point source or nonpoint source for which there is a control document or reviewable action, as a result of any activity including, but not limited to: (i) Construction of a new regulated facility or modification of an existing regulated facility such that a new or modified control document is required; (ii) Modification of an existing regulated facility operating under a current control document such that the production capacity of the facility is increased; (iii) Addition of a new source of untreated or pretreated effluent containing or expected to contain any PBT to an existing wastewater treatment works, whether public or private; (iv) A request for an increased limit in an applicable control document; (v) Other deliberate activities that, based on the information available, could be reasonably expected to result in an increased loading of any pollutant to Tribal surface waters. 2. Notwithstanding the above, changes in loadings of any Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxic within the existing capacity and processes, and that are covered by the existing applicable control document, are not subject to an antidegradation review. These changes include, but are not limited to: a. Normal operational variability; b. Changes in intake water pollutants; c. Increasing the production hours of the facility, (e.g., adding a second shift); or d. Increasing the rate of production. 3. Also, excluded from an antidegradation review are new effluent limits based on improved monitoring data or new water quality criteria or values that are not a result of changes in pollutant loading. 4. For all waters, the Environment Division shall ensure that the level of water quality necessary to protect existing uses is maintained. In order to achieve this requirement, water quality standards use designations must include all existing uses. Controls shall be established as necessary on point and nonpoint sources of pollutants to ensure that the criteria applicable to the designated use are achieved in the water and that any designated use of a downstream water is protected. Where water quality does not support the designated uses of a water body or ambient pollutant concentrations exceed water quality criteria applicable to that water body, the Environment Division shall not allow a lowering of water quality for the pollutant or pollutants preventing the attainment of such uses or exceeding such criteria. 5. For Outstanding Resource Waters: a. The Environment Division shall ensure, through the application of appropriate controls on pollutant sources, that water quality is maintained and protected. b. Exception. A short-term, temporary (i.e., weeks or months) lowering of water quality may be permitted by the Environment Division (or US EPA where SRMT is the permittee). c. For Natural State, high quality waters, the Environment Division shall ensure that no action resulting in a lowering of water quality occurs unless an antidegradation demonstration has been completed pursuant to Section C and the information thus provided is determined by the Environment Division pursuant to Section B of this Antidegradation Standard to adequately support the lowering of water quality. 6. The Environment Division or EPA shall establish conditions in the control document applicable to the regulated facility that prohibit the regulated facility from undertaking any deliberate action, such that there would be an increase in the rate of mass loading of any pollutant, unless an antidegradation demonstration is provided to the Environment Division and approved pursuant to Section D prior to commencement of the action. Imposition of limits due to improved monitoring data or new water quality criteria or values, or changes in loadings of any pollutant within the existing capacity and processes, and that are covered by the existing applicable control document, are not subject to an antidegradation review. 7. For PBTs known or believed to be present in a discharge, from a point or nonpoint source, a monitoring requirement shall be included in the control document. The control document shall also include a provision requiring the source to notify the Environment Division of any increased loadings. Upon notification, the Environment Division shall require actions as necessary to reduce or eliminate the increased loading. 8. Fact Sheets prepared for public review and comment shall reflect any conditions developed under this Antidegradation Standard and included in a permit. 9. Exemptions. Except as the Environment Division may determine on a case- by-case basis that the application of these procedures is required to adequately protect water quality, or as the affected water body is an Outstanding Resource Water as defined in Section B of this Antidegradation Standard, the procedures in this part do not apply to: a. Short-term, temporary (i.e., weeks or months) lowering of water quality; b. Bypasses that are not prohibited at 40 CFR 122.41(m); and c. Response actions pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended, or similar Federal, State or Tribal authorities, undertaken to alleviate a release into the environment of hazardous substances or pollutants which may pose an imminent and substantial danger to public health or welfare. C. Antidegradation Demonstration: Any entity seeking to lower water quality in a High Quality Water must first, as required by Section B of this Antidegradation Standard, submit an antidegradation demonstration for consideration by the Environment Division. The antidegradation demonstration shall include the following: 1. Pollution Prevention Alternatives Analysis. Identify any cost-effective pollution prevention alternatives and techniques that are available to the entity, that would eliminate or significantly reduce the extent to which the increased loading results in a lowering of water quality. 2. Alternative or Enhanced Treatment Analysis. Identify alternative or enhanced treatment techniques that are available to the entity that would eliminate the lowering of water quality and their costs relative to the cost of treatment necessary to achieve applicable effluent limitations. 3. Important Social or Economic Development Analysis. Identify the social or economic development and the benefits to the area in which the waters are located that will be foregone if the lowering of water quality is not allowed. 4. Special Provision for Remedial Actions. Entities proposing remedial actions pursuant to the CERCLA, as amended, corrective actions pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or similar actions pursuant to other Federal, State or Tribal environmental statutes may submit information to the Environment Division that demonstrates that the action utilizes the most cost effective pollution prevention and treatment techniques available, and minimizes the necessary lowering of water quality, in lieu of the information required by Section B of this Antidegradation Standard. D. Antidegradation Decision: Once the Environment Division determines that the information provided by the entity proposing to increase loadings is administratively complete, the Environment Division shall use that information to determine whether or not the lowering of water quality is necessary, and, if it is necessary, whether or not the lowering of water quality will support important social and economic development in the area. If the proposed lowering of water quality is either not necessary, or will not support important social and economic development, the Environment Division shall deny the request to lower water quality. If the lowering of water quality is necessary, and will support important social and economic development, the Environment Division may allow all or part of the proposed lowering to occur as necessary to accommodate important social and economic development. E. Mixing Zones: 1. Where effluent is discharged into surface waters, a continuous zone shall be maintained in which the water is of adequate quality to allow the migration of aquatic life with no significant effect on their population. The cross-sectional zone area of wastewater mixing zones shall generally be less than 1/4 of the cross-sectional area or flow volume of the receiving river, stream or lake. Unmixed zones containing permitted effluent shall not be at locations of recreational or ceremonial use. (See Section V, below.) Water quality standards shall be maintained throughout Zones of Passage. Zones of passage in intermittent streams may be designated on a site specific basis. The water quality in a Zone of Passage shall not fall below standards for the designated water body(ies) within which the zone is contained. 2. Mixing zones will not be granted for discharges to outstanding resource water, wetlands, or ephemeral or intermittent streams. 3. Mixing zones will not be granted for Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics (PBT) consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 132. See appendix 1. Waste Load Applications (WLAs) in the absence of TMDLs, and WLAs for the purposes of determining the need for water quality based effluent limits (WQBELs) for new discharges of PBTs shall be set equal to the most stringent applicable criteria or values for the PBTs in question. 4. Mixing zones shall not be used for, or considered as, a substitute for waste treatment. F. Allowance for Compliance Schedules NPDES permits, and other orders and directives of the Division issued under Tribal Council, for existing discharges or activities may include a schedule for achieving compliance with water quality criteria contained herein, consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR Parts 131.15 and 132. These compliance schedules shall be developed to ensure compliance with the water quality standards set forth in the shortest practicable time period, not to exceed five years. Decisions regarding whether to issue compliance schedules will be done on a case-by-case basis by the Tribal Council and approved by the Division, or the EPA where appropriate. These schedules will not be issued for new discharges or activities. G. Water Quality Standards Variances It is the SRMT's policy that a water quality standards variance is only appropriate when a designated use is not attainable in the short-term but might be attainable in the long-term. The SRMT may consider a temporary modification to a designated use and associated water quality criteria that would otherwise apply. (a) Applicability: A variance from any WQS that is the basis of a water quality-based effluent limitation included in a Permit is based on the following: (1) A variance from WQS applies only to the permittee requesting the WQS variance, the water body/waterbody segment(s) specified in the WQS variance and only to the pollutant or pollutants specified in the WQS variance. (2) A WQS variance does not affect, or require the SRMT to modify, in its standards, the underlying designated use and criterion address by the WQS variance, unless the SRMT adopts and EPA approves a revision to the underlying designated use and criterion consistent with \u00a7131.10 and \u00a7131.11. All other applicable standards not specifically addressed by the WQS variance remain applicable. (3) A variance does not affect, or require SRMT to modify, the corresponding water quality standard for the waterbody as a whole. (4) A WQS variance, once adopted by the SRMT and approved by EPA, shall be the applicable standard for purposes of the CWA under 40 CFR 131.21(d)-(e), for the following limited purposes. An approved WQS variance applies for the purposes of developing permit limits and requirements under 301(b)(1)(C), where appropriate, consistent with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The SRMT and other certifying entities may also use an approved WQS variance when issuing certifications under section 401 of the CWA. (5) A variance from a water quality standard shall not be granted that would likely jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species listed under Section 4 of the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) Act or result in the destruction or adverse modification of such species' critical habitat. (6) A variance from WQS shall not be granted if standards will be attained by implementing effluent limits required under sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA and by the permittee implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. (b) The maximum timeframe: A variance from the WQS shall not exceed five (5) years or the term of the permit, whichever is less. The SRMT will review, and modify as necessary, variances from WQS as part of each water quality standards review pursuant to section 303(c) of the CWA. (c) Conditions to grant: A variance from the WQS may be granted if, and only if: (1) The permittee demonstrates to the SRMT that attaining the WQS is not feasible because: (A) Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the attainment of the WQS; (B) Natural, ephemeral, intermittent or low flow conditions or water levels prevent the attainment of the WQS, unless these conditions may be compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent to enable WQS to be met without violating the SRMT's water conservation requirements; (C) Human-caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the attainment of the WQS and cannot be remedied, or would cause more environmental damage to correct than to leave in place; (D) Dams, diversions or other types of hydrologic modifications preclude the attainment of the WQS, and it is not feasible to restore the waterbody to its original condition or to operate such modification in a way that would result in the attainment of the WQS; (E) Physical conditions related to the natural features of the waterbody, such as the lack of a proper substrate cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the like, unrelated to chemical water quality, preclude attainment of WQS; or (F) Controls more stringent than those required by sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact. (2) The permittee shall also: (A) Show that the WQS variance requested conforms to the requirements of the antidegradation procedures in Section III.A; and (B) Characterize the extent of any increased risk to human health and the environment associated with granting the WQS variance compared with compliance with WQS absent the variance, such that the SRMT is able to conclude that any such increased risk is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. (d) Requirements for Submission of Application to the SRMT: (1) An application for a WQS variance must include: (A) Identification of the pollutant(s) or water quality parameter(s), and the water body/waterbody segment(s) to which the WQS variance applies. Discharger(s)-specific WQS variances must also identify the permittee(s) subject to the WQS variance. (B) The requirements that apply throughout the term of the WQS variance. The requirements shall represent the highest attainable condition of the water body or waterbody segment applicable throughout the term of the WQS variance based on the documentation required in (d)(2) of this section. The requirements shall not result in any lowering of the currently attained ambient water quality, unless a WQS variance is necessary for restoration activities, consistent with paragraph (d)(2)(A)(i)(b) of this section. DPNR must specify the highest attainable condition of the water body or waterbody segment as a quantifiable expression that is one of the following: (i) For discharger(s)-specific WQS variances: (a) The highest attainable interim criterion, or (b) The interim effluent condition that reflects the greatest pollutant reduction achievable, or (c) If no additional feasible pollutant control technology can be identified, the interim criterion or interim effluent condition that reflects the greatest pollutant reduction achievable with the pollutant control technologies installed at the time the Territory adopts the WQS variance, and the adoption and implementation of a Pollutant Minimization Program. (ii) For WQS variances applicable to a water body or waterbody segment: (a) The highest attainable interim use and interim criterion, or (b) If no additional feasible pollutant control technology can be identified, the interim use and interim criterion that reflects the greatest pollutant reduction achievable with the pollutant control technologies installed at the time the Territory adopts the WQS variance, and the adoption and implementation of a Pollutant Minimization Program. (C) A statement providing that the requirements of the WQS variance are either the highest attainable condition identified at the time of the adoption of the WQS variance. (D) The term of the WQS variance, expressed as an interval of time from the date of the SRMT approval or a specific date. The term of the WQS variance must only be as long as necessary to achieve the highest attainable condition and consistent with the demonstration provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The SRMT may adopt a subsequent WQS variance consistent with this section. (2) The supporting documentation must include: (A) Documentation demonstrating the need for a WQS variance. (i) For a WQS variance to a use specified in section 101(a)(2) of the CWA or a sub-category of such a use, the SRMT must demonstrate that attaining the designated use and criterion is not feasible throughout the term of the WQS variance because: (a) All relevant information demonstrating that attaining the WQS is not feasible based on one or more of the conditions in \u00a7186-14 (c)(1) herein; or (b) Actions necessary to facilitate lake, wetland, or stream restoration through dam removal or other significant reconfiguration activities preclude attainment of the designated use and criterion while the actions are being implemented. (ii) For a WQS variance to a non-101(a)(2) use, the SRMT must submit documentation justifying how its consideration of the use and value of the water for those uses listed in \u00a7 131.10(a) appropriately supports the WQS variance and term. A demonstration consistent with (d)(2)(A)(i) of this section may be used to satisfy this requirement. (B) Documentation demonstrating that the term of the WQS variance is only as long as necessary to achieve the highest attainable condition. Such documentation must justify the term of the WQS variance by describing the pollutant control activities to achieve the highest attainable condition, including those activities identified through a Pollutant Minimization Program, which serve as milestones for the WQS variance. (C) In addition to (A) and (B) of this section, for a WQS variance that applies to a water body or waterbody segment: (i) Identification and documentation of any cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source controls related to the pollutant(s) or water quality parameter(s) and water body or waterbody segment(s) specified in the WQS variance that could be implemented to make progress towards attaining the underlying designated use and criterion. DPNR must provide public notice and comment for any such documentation. (ii) Any subsequent WQS variance for a water body or waterbody segment must include documentation of whether and to what extent best management practices for nonpoint source controls were implemented to address the pollutant(s) or water quality parameter(s) subject to the WQS variance and the water quality progress achieved. (D) All relevant information demonstrating compliance with the conditions in (c)(2) herein. (e) Implementing WQS variances in NPDES permits: A WQS variance serves as the applicable water quality standard for implementing permitting requirements pursuant to 40 CFR \u00a7 122.44(d) for the term of the WQS variance. Any limitations and requirements necessary to implement the WQS variance shall be included as enforceable conditions of the permit for the permittee(s) subject to the WQS variance. (f) Public notice of preliminary decision: Upon receipt of a complete application for a variance from the WQS, and upon making a preliminary decision regarding the WQS variance, the SRMT shall public notice the request and preliminary decision for public comment. This public notice will be satisfied by including the supporting information for the variance from the WQS and the preliminary decision in the public notice of a draft TPDES permit. (g) Final decision: The SRMT will issue a final decision on a WQS variance request within 90 days of the expiration of the public comment period required in accordance with the permit. If the SRMT approves all or part of the variance from the WQS, the decision shall include all permit conditions needed to implement those parts of the WQS variance as approved. Such permit conditions shall, at a minimum, require: (1) Compliance with an initial effluent limitation which, at the time the variance from the WQS is granted, represents the level currently achievable by the permittee, and which is no less stringent than that achieved under the previous permit; (2) Achieving reasonable progress toward attaining the water quality standards for the waterbody as a whole through appropriate conditions; (3) When the duration of a variance from the WQS is shorter than the duration of a permit, compliance with an effluent limitation sufficient to meet the underlying water quality standard, upon the expiration of said WQS variance; and (4) A provision that allows the SRMT to reopen and modify or revoke any condition granted in a WQS variance due to the permittee not providing relevant information that reasonable would affect the decision process. (h) Incorporating the WQS variance: The SRMT will establish and incorporate into the permittee's permit all conditions needed to implement the variance from the WQS as determined in (g) herein. (i) Renewal of WQS variance: A WQS variance may be renewed, subject to the requirements of (a) through (h) herein. As part of any renewal application, the permittee shall again demonstrate that attaining the WQS is not feasible based on the requirements of (c). The permittee's application shall also contain information concerning its compliance with the conditions incorporated into its permit as part of the original variance from the WQS pursuant to (g) through (h) herein. Renewal of a WQS variance may be denied if the permittee did not comply with the conditions of the original WQS variance. (j) EPA Approval: The SRMT shall submit all variances from the WQS and supporting information to EPA Region 2 for approval. The submittal shall include: (1) Relevant permittee applications pursuant to (d), (2) Public comments and records of any public hearings pursuant to (f), (3) The final decision pursuant to (g) of this procedure, and (4) Permits issued pursuant to (h) of this procedure. Section IV. General Conditions A. General Conditions The following conditions shall apply to the water quality criteria and classifications set forth herein. 1. All Tribal Surface Waters shall be free from pollutants in concentrations or combinations that do not protect the most sensitive use of the water body, except as provided under mixing zones. 2. Whenever the natural conditions of surface water of the Tribe are of a lower quality than the aquatic life criteria assigned, the Division may determine that the natural conditions shall constitute the aquatic life water quality criteria. If a natural condition varies with time, the natural condition will be determined as the highest quality prevailing natural condition measured during an annual, seasonal, or shorter time period prior to influence of human-caused pollution. The Division may, at its discretion, determine a natural condition for one or more seasonal or shorter time period(s) to reflect variable ambient conditions. 3. All waters shall attain and maintain a level of water quality that provides for the attainment and maintenance of the water quality standards of downstream waters. At the boundary between waters of different classifications, the water quality standards that are more stringent will prevail. When a distinction cannot be made between surface water, wetlands, groundwater, or sediments, then the applicable standards shall depend upon which existing or designated use is, or could be, adversely affected. If the uses of more than one resource are affected, than the most protective criteria shall apply. 4. The Division may revise criteria on a territory-wide or water body-specific basis as needed to protect aquatic life and human health and other existing and designated uses, and also to increase the technical accuracy of the criteria being applied. The Division shall formally adopt any revised criteria following public review and comment. B. General Narrative and Numeric Criteria The following Narrative Criteria apply to all Tribal Surface Waters of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, including intermittent streams and within designated mixing zones. 1. Suspended, colloidal and settleable solids: Tribal surface waters shall be free from suspended, colloidal and settleable solids that will cause deposition or impair the waters for their designated uses. 2. Oil, grease and any floating substances: Tribal Surface Waters shall be free from oil and grease, including visible oil film and globules of oil. 3. Color: Tribal Surface Waters shall be free from substances that will adversely affect the color or impair the water of their designated uses. Color-producing substances from other than natural sources are limited to concentrations equivalent to 15 color units (CU). 4. Odor and Taste: Tribal Surface Waters shall be free from substances that will adversely affect the taste, odor thereof, or impair the water of their designated uses. 5. Nitrogen and Phosphorus: Tribal Surface Waters shall be free from nutrients in concentrations that will result in growths of algae, weeds and slimes that will impair their designated uses. 6. Pathogens: Designated Uses of Tribal Surface Waters shall not be impaired by pathogens, as measured by Pathogen Indicator Bacteria, pursuant to SRMT swimming and bathing criteria in Section VI(A). 7. Turbidity: Turbidity attributable to other than natural causes, shall not reduce light transmission to a point that causes an unaesthetic and substantial visible contrast with the natural appearance of the water. 8. Temperature Thermal discharge: The introduction of heat by other than natural causes shall not increase the temperature in a stream, outside a mixing zone, by more than 2.7\u00b0C (5\u00b0F), based upon the monthly average of the maximum daily temperatures measured at mid-depth or three feet (whichever is less) outside the mixing zone. The normal daily and seasonal variations that were present before the addition of heat from other than natural sources shall be maintained. In no case shall man-introduced heat be permitted when the maximum temperature specified for the reach (20\u00b0C/68\u00b0F for cold water fisheries and 32.2\u00b0C/90\u00b0F for warm water fisheries) would thereby be exceeded. a. Exclusions. Privately owned ponds that do not combine with other Tribal Surface Waters are exempt from this thermal discharge standard. However, waters released from any such pond into a stream or river must meet Tribal Water Quality Standards of the receiving water body. 9. Salinity/Mineral Quality (total dissolved solids, chlorides, and sulfates): Existing mineral quality shall not be altered by municipal, industrial, and instream activities, or other waste discharges so as to interfere with the designated uses for a water body. An increase of more than 1/3 over naturally-occurring levels shall not be permitted. In no case shall dischargers cause concentrations in rivers with a domestic water supply use to exceed 250 mg/l of chlorides, 250 mg/l sulfates and 500 mg/l total dissolved solids. 10. pH: The pH of Tribal Surface Waters shall not be permitted to fluctuate in excess of 1.0 unit over a period of 24 hours for other than natural causes or outside the range 6.5-8.5 11. Garbage, cinders, ashes, sludge, concrete wash and other refuse: Tribal Surface waters shall be free of these items in any amount. 12. Dissolved Oxygen: The DO standard for the protection of aquatic life in surface waters shall not be less than a daily average of 6.0 mg/l, and at no time less than 5.0. For water bodies used as spawning habitat by cold water fishes (e.g. salmonids) the DO standard shall be no less than 7.0 mg/l from other than natural conditions. 13. Flow: There shall be no alteration of flow that will impair the waters for their designated uses. 14. Radioactivity: The Radioactivity should be kept at the lowest practicable levels, and in any event should be controlled to the extent necessary to prevent harmful effects on health. C. Toxic Substances: 1. Toxic substances shall not be present in receiving waters in quantities that are toxic to humans or aquatic life, or in quantities that interfere with normal propagation, growth, and survival of sensitive indigenous aquatic life. For toxic substances lacking published criteria, bioassay data for sensitive indigenous test species/lifestages may be used to determine compliance with these narrative criteria 2. Standards for toxic substances are listed in Appendix 1. 3. Note that any future standards which may be derived for toxic substances, and added to Appendix 1, shall be as protective as those which would be derived using the methodologies for calculating water quality criteria found in 40 CFR Part 132. 4. SRMT Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs): SRMT has an ARAR specific to a class of pollutants called Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) (TCR NO. 89-19). The ARARs are applicable to ambient conditions and cleanup standards as follows: Media Concentration Sediments 0.1 ug/kg Soils 1.0 ug/g Surface Waters 1.0 pg/l Groundwaters 10.0 pg/l Air 5.0 ng/m3 D. Biological Criteria: 1. All surface waters of the Tribe shall be of sufficient quality to support aquatic life without detrimental changes in the resident aquatic communities. 2. Tribal surface waters shall be free from substances, whether attributable to point sources discharges, nonpoint sources, or instream activities, in concentrations or combinations which would impair the structure or limit the function of the resident aquatic community as it naturally occurs. 3. Determination of impairment or limitation of the resident aquatic community shall be based on a comparison with the aquatic community found at an appropriate reference site or region. E. Wildlife Criteria: 1. All surface waters of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe shall be of sufficient quality to protect and support all life stages of resident and/or migratory wildlife species which live in, on, or near the waters of the Akwesasne Territory. 2. Specific Wildlife-based Standards for toxic substances are listed in Appendix 1. F. Wetlands: 1. All wetlands within the exterior boundaries of the territory that are not constructed wetlands shall be subject to the Narrative Criteria ( Section IV , subsection 2 ), Antidegradation (section 2) and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Wetlands Protection Act. www.srmtenv.org/wetlands 2. Water quality in wetlands shall be maintained at naturally occurring levels, within the natural range of variation for the individual wetland, unless otherwise specified and approved by the Environment Division. 3. Physical and biological characteristics shall be maintained and protected by: a. Maintaining hydrological conditions, including hydroperiod, hydrodynamics, and natural water temperature variations; b. Maintaining the natural hydrophytic vegetation; c. Maintaining substrate characteristics necessary to support existing and designated uses. 4. Point and Nonpoint sources of pollution shall not cause destruction or impairment of wetlands except where authorized under Section 404 of the CWA. 5. Natural wetlands shall not be used as repositories or treatment systems for wastes from human sources. Section V. Water Body Classifications And Standards Specific To Uses A. Water Body Classifications by Environmental Conditions 1. Class N, Natural State The designated uses of Class N waters include: the enjoyment of water in its natural condition and, where compatible, as a source of water for drinking or culinary purposes, bathing, fishing, fish, shellfish, and wildlife propagation and survival, primary and secondary contact recreation, and ceremonial use. There shall be no discharge of sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes, waste effluents or any sewage effluents not having had filtration resulting from at least 200 feet of lateral travel through unconsolidated earth. A greater distance may be required if inspection shows that, due to peculiar geologic conditions, this distance is inadequate to protect the water from pollution. These waters shall contain no deleterious substances, hydrocarbons or substances that would contribute to eutrophication, nor shall they receive surface runoff containing any such substance. 2. Class AA-Special The designated uses of Class AA-S waters include: a source of water supply for drinking, culinary or food processing purposes, primary and secondary contact recreation, fishing, and ceremonial use, and fish, shellfish, and wildlife propagation and survival. These waters shall contain no floating solids, settleable solids, oil, sludge deposits, toxic wastes, deleterious substances, colored or other wastes or heated liquids attributable to sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes. There shall be no discharge or disposal of sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into these waters. 3. Class A-Special The designated uses of Class A-S waters include: a source of water supply for drinking, culinary or food processing purposes, primary and secondary contact recreation, fishing, ceremonial use, and fish, shellfish, and wildlife propagation and survival. This classification may be given to those international boundary waters that, if subjected to approved treatment, equal to coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection with additional treatment, if necessary, to reduce naturally present impurities, meet or will meet EPA drinking water standards and are or will be considered safe and satisfactory for drinking water purposes. 4. Class AA The designated uses of Class AA waters include: a source of water supply for drinking, culinary or food processing purposes, primary and secondary contact recreation, fishing, ceremonial use, and fish, shellfish, and wildlife propagation and survival. This classification may be given to those waters that, if subjected to approved disinfection treatment, with additional treatment if necessary, to remove naturally present impurities, meet or will meet EPA-drinking water standards and are or will be considered safe and satisfactory for drinking water purposes. 5. Class A The designated uses for Class A waters include: source of water supply for drinking, culinary or food processing purposes, primary and secondary contact recreation, fishing, ceremonial use and fish, shellfish and wildlife propagation and survival. This classification may be given to those waters that, if subjected to approved treatment equal to coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection, with additional treatment if necessary, to reduce naturally present impurities, meet or will meet US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards and are or will be considered safe and satisfactory for drinking water purposes. 6. Class B The designated uses for Class B waters include: primary and secondary contact recreation, ceremonial use, fish, shellfish and wildlife propagation and survival, and fishing. 7. Class C The designated uses for Class C waters include: primary and secondary contact recreation, ceremonial use, and fish, shellfish and wildlife propagation and survival, and fishing. However, due to such natural conditions as intermittency of flow, water conditions not conducive to propagation of game fishery, or stream bed conditions, the waters may not support fish propagation, primary and secondary contact recreation or ceremonial uses. B. Designated Fisheries 1. Cold Water Fishery. A cold water fishery is a water body where water temperature and other characteristics provide for propagation and survival of cold water fish (e.g. family Salmonidae). 2. Warm Water Fishery: A warm water fishery is a water body where water temperature and other characteristics provide for propagation and survival and propagation of warm water fish (e.g. families Centrachidae, Esocidae and others). C. Groundwater 1. Class GA The designated use of Class GA waters is as a source of potable water supply. Class GA waters are fresh ground waters. 2. Class GSA The designated uses include: a source of potable mineral waters, or conversion to fresh potable waters, or as raw material for the manufacture of sodium chloride or its derivatives or similar products. Class GSA waters are saline ground waters. In addition to the classes specified above please see Table 1 below for addition information on Designated Uses. Section VI. Designated Uses A. Primary Contact Recreation and Ceremonial Use. Primary contact recreation and ceremonial use means the use of a stream, river, or impoundment involving the following: prolonged contact and the risk of ingesting water in quantities sufficient to pose a health hazard (including but not limited to swimming, skin diving and water skiing) or religious, cultural, and traditional activities of the members of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and Mohawk Council of Akwesasne, or citizens of the Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs (including but not limited to collection of medicinal plants and collection of water for ceremonial use). Standards specific to the use are as follows: 1. The open water shall be free from algae in concentrations causing nuisance conditions, or gastrointestinal illness or skin disorders. 2. E. coli. Levels shall not exceed a 30-day geometric mean of 126 per 100 ml, nor shall more than 10 percent of the samples collected in the same 30 days exceed 410 CFU/100 ml. Table 1. Designated Uses The Designated Uses described herein shall not be used to limit any treaty right of the Saint Regis Mohawks or Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs. Below is a list of Designated Uses for the three major rivers within the boundaries of the Saint Regis Indian Reservation and are presented here to give examples of current Tribal uses specific to each water body. The water bodies are classified as follows: St Lawrence River, Class A-S; Raquette River, Class B; and St. Regis River, Class B. This is not intended to be exhaustive list of uses for these water bodies. Designated use St. Lawrence (Class A-S) St. Regis (Class B) Raquette (Class B) 1 Domestic, municipal water supply X X* [GB1] 2 Agricultural or farm water supply X X 3 Primary Contact Recreation X X X 4 Ceremonial and cultural use X X X 5 Medicinal plant collection X X X 6 Fish and aquatic life use X X X 7 Cold Water Fishery X X X 8 Fish Consumption X X X 9 Navigation X X X * It is estimated that during times of peak flow the Raquette River mixes with the St Lawrence at the point of intake for the SRMT drinking water treatment plant and provides a maximum contribution of approximately 15% to the SRMT drinking water intake. Under normal flow conditions it is estimated that this contribution is reduced to between 0% and 2% of daily intake. ** Subsistence fish consumption has been an ongoing practice ; however, the current WQ does not does not support this use for all individuals. Women of child bearing age and children are advised to restrict consumption to certain species and reduced quantities (fewer than 8, 4 oz. portions per month). SRMT currently defines subsistence fishing as consuming locally caught fish at a daily average rate of 150g/dy or 40 portions per month. Section VII. Sampling And Analysis A. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Analysis Sample collection, preservation, and analysis used to determine compliance with the water Quality Standards set forth in this document and maintain the standards set forth in the Water Quality Standards this document MUST meet the minimal requirements and consistency of procedures of any of the following: 1.

TITLE This Ordinance shall be known as the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Land Laws and Dispute Ordinance. II. AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE A. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council (\"Tribal Council\" or \"Council\") is the duly recognized governing body of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (\"Tribe\") and is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all members of the Tribe. The Tribe has the inherent authority to control the ownership of property and the issuance of use and occupancy deeds for property within the Tribe's Reservation. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Tribal Clerk (\"Tribal Clerk\") has the authority to record title and land transfers that occur between members on the Reservation. B. This Ordinance is intended to set forth general rules for the issuance of deeds and the transfer of title and land interests on the Reservation. In addition, this Ordinance is intended to delegate to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court (\"Tribal Court\" or \"Court\") the authority to resolve land disputes. C. This Ordinance shall apply to all lands within the boundaries of the 1796 Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Reservation. III. DEFINITIONS A. \"Boundary line agreement\" is a written agreement between adjacent landowners by which each landowner agrees to the written description of the location of the border that delineates each property-one from the other. B. \"Certified Copy\" is a copy of a document that has been certified by the Tribal Clerk as a true and accurate copy of the original document. C. \"Child(ren)\" / \"grandchild(ren)\" refers to a natural born or legally adopted child, or grandchild, as long as the child is a Tribal Member or eligible to become a Tribal Member. D. \"Claimant\" is the person who files a land dispute claim in Tribal Court. E. \"Interested Party\" is any Tribal Member who claims to have an interest in the outcome of the proceeding and who seeks to participate in a land dispute proceeding. \"Interested party\" does not include a Tribal member without a recognizable interest in resolution of the case. A Tribal Member seeking to participate as an interested party and who has an identifiable and known legal interest in the disputed property shall be treated as an Intervenor and will be bound by the Court's rulings. F. \"Land Dispute\" is a disagreement between Tribal Members over claims to title, boundary lines, issuance or validity of deeds, transactions, and any other matter regarding property interests on the Reservation. The issuance of a Use and Occupancy Deed by the Tribe and the Tribal Clerk, even if in error, does not create a land dispute involving the Tribe. Any claim that a deed has been issued in error is to be resolved as a land dispute between the parties claiming an interest in the property and, when resolved, could result in a court order to the Tribe to issue a new deed or to revise or revoke an existing deed. G. \"Legal Guardian\" is a parent or an individual legally appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction as the guardian of minor children. H. \"Life estate\" is a way of holding real property that is limited to the life of the party holding it and, upon whose death, the property reverts to another Tribal Member. I. \"Recorded\" refers to the filing or registration of documents or transactions with the Tribal Clerk's Office so as to memorialize the registration or transaction document in accordance with established procedures. J. \"Respondent\" is the person against whom a land dispute claim is filed. The Tribe, the Tribal Council, the Tribal Clerk, or any tribal official may not be named as a Respondent in a land dispute for the official act of issuing a deed. This limitation, however, is subject to the limited waiver of immunity in this Ordinance . The Tribe may be named as a Respondent if a deed is issued to the Tribe itself or if the Tribe is claiming an interest in any land subject to a claim. K. \"Spouse\" refers only to a legally married husband or wife. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe does not recognize \"common law\" marriage. L. \"Tribal Council\" for purposes of this ordinance, refers to the three duly elected Chiefs of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. M. \"Tribal Member\" for purposes of this ordinance, includes anyone who is enrolled with the Saint Regis MohawkTribe or eligible for enrollment with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. IV. TRIBAL LAW, CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES A. Application of Customs and Practices. The customs and practices of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe shall be applied in all situations where it is relevant to resolve a land dispute. B. Order of Consideration. Written tribal laws will be considered first. If no written Tribal law applies to the circumstance raised in a dispute, the Tribe's customs and practices may be considered. C. Resolution of Ambiguity. Where any doubt arises as to past practices and customs, the Court, with the agreement of both parties, may request the advice of Tribal Members who may be familiar with the Tribe's customs and practices, or the Court may pose a certified question to the Tribal Council or the Tribal Clerk. If issues of doubt regarding past practices and customs are presented in Tribal Court, the matter must be resolved through normal tribal court procedure for witness and evidence collection. D. Acknowledgment. The Tribe acknowledges that Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs uses its own process to record property ownership of its members, which may be recognized by the Tribe as evidence of property ownership for the Tribe's land recording purposes or to resolve land disputes brought to the Tribe. E. Guiding Legal Principles. In order to resolve land disputes according to tribal customs and practices, this Ordinance will set forth the general legal principles that have governed land use and occupancy on the reservation. 1. Power to Issue Deeds is Reserved . The power to make land assignments and to issue Use and Occupancy Deeds is vested in the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council as the sovereign government with jurisdiction and authority over the Reservation. The Tribal Council and the Tribal Clerk issue deeds in their official capacity based on deeds, contracts and other agreements or documents such as wills. 2. Resolution of Disputes . The Tribal Council shall exercise its discretion and judgment in issuing deeds and it may do so upon request of a Tribal Member with the presentation of proper documentation. It is recognized that a request to the Council to issue a deed may change the ownership of land in a way that may negatively affect a Tribal Member. The issuance of a deed by the Tribal Council and the Tribal Clerk does not constitute the resolution of a land dispute. If a Tribal Member disagrees with the recordation or issuance of a deed, the remedy is to file a land dispute claim in Tribal Court. 3. Forms of Evidence of Land Ownership . The following documentation may be considered valid evidence of land ownership for all or a portion of land identified in a Use and Occupancy Deed: (a) Official and Original or Certified Copy of a Use and Occupancy Deed issued and signed by the Tribal Council and recorded in the Tribal Clerk's records. (b) Valid Land Contract. (c) Valid Will (a will that meets the requirements of the Probate Law). (d) Valid Bill of Sale. (e) Valid receipt for the purchase of property if accompanied by other evidence to substantiate a sale of property. (f) Prior Tribal Council finding. (g) Prior Tribal Court finding. (h) Decisions from other Courts. (i) Sworn written testimony. (j) Sworn oral testimony. (k) Any other relevant evidence. 4. Limitation on Who May Use and Occupy Land. (a) Only Tribal Members shall be permitted to possess a Use and Occupancy Deed on the Reservation. A corporation, limited liability corporation, or trust either testamentary or inter vivos shall not be permitted to possess a Use and Occupancy Deed on the Reservation even if such entity is formulated under Tribal law; provided however that wholly-owned Tribal entities or those created by the Tribe that are formed for the benefit of the Tribe may use and possess land as needed. (b) In any case where a Tribal Member wants to transfer land to a minor Tribal Member, the land shall be held in trust by a legal guardian until the minor Tribal Member reaches the age of majority, which is eighteen (18) years old. When the minor Tribal Member reaches the age of majority the legal guardian's trust obligation shall no longer have any force or effect. The legal guardian shall have a fiduciary responsibility to the minor Tribal Member until the minor reaches the age of majority. 5. Limitation on the Right to Transfer . Reservation land may not be sold to, held by, pledged, assigned, or in any way relinquished to a non-member of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. 6. Assumptions Regarding Land Ownership . (a) When two or more Tribal Members are listed as owners of property and are granted the interest simultaneously, the owners shall be deemed joint tenants with rights of survivorship, unless expressly declared to be tenants in common. As joint tenants, the owners will own equal undivided shares. Upon the death of one of the tenants, that share will be distributed equally to the remaining tenants (survivorship). A joint tenant may transfer his/her share, but that transfer will automatically change the ownership between the transferring joint tenant and the non- transferring joint tenants to tenants in common. The transfer does not change the relationship between the non-transferring joint tenants. (b) If a deed declares the property will be held as tenants in common, each owner will own the property in equal shares unless different portions are expressly stated in the deed and each owner is entitled to possess the whole. A tenant in common may sell his/her share to anyone. If a tenant dies, there is no right of survivorship with the other tenants and that share will pass through inheritance as provided for in the Probate Ordinance. (c) A deed held by a husband and wife creates a tenancy by the entirety, unless expressly declared to be a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common. A tenancy in the entirety means that upon the death of one spouse, the property automatically passes to the surviving spouse and probate is not necessary. (d) These assumptions shall apply to all deeds existing on the date the amendments to this Ordinance are adopted unless the Tribal Member/s request the deeds be amended to reflect the intention of the owners that may be different than the assumptions enacted here. 7. Use and Occupancy Deed . A Use and Occupancy Deed is an official Tribal document granting the holder the right to use and occupy land at the will of the Tribe, signed by the Tribal Council and certified by the Tribal Clerk. (a) All land assignments and deeds made or issued by the Council are presumptively valid. The deed recorded first with the Tribal Clerk of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe will supersede all other deeds, unless it can be shown that the deed recorded first is subject to challenge under subparagraph (b). (b) A deed issued and/or recorded by the Tribal Clerk may only be challenged if (i) there has been a substantial error committed by the Tribal Council or Clerk in issuing the deed; (ii) there is evidence of fraud in the documents used to substantiate the issuance of the deed; or (iii) evidence of fraud, deceit, coercion or duress in the signing of documents or in the transfer made in the deed. The party challenging the deed has the burden of proof to show with clear and convincing evidence that a deed was not properly issued or recorded. (c) The Tribal Council has the right to correct or amend deeds in order to correct language or typographical errors and these corrections may not be reviewed. The Tribal Council also has the right to correct clerical errors, including errors that may have resulted in a deed being issued in violation of a previously recorded valid deed. Tribal Council, however, shall provide written notice to all affected parties of the error and of its intent to make a correction. (d) Correction of clerical errors may be challenged and shall be reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard, and a party may seek declaratory or injunctive relief. (e) If a land claim dispute is filed, all actions by all parties in relation to the property in dispute shall be stayed pending review. (f) All recorded deeds must bear the signature of the Tribal Council along with the signature and seal of the Tribal Clerk. (g) Use and Occupancy Deeds may be transferred between Tribal Members either through a land contract, a bill of sale, by simple purchase, or as a gift between family members. In order to ensure the Tribe's land records are current and accurate and reflect the current ownership, upon the effective date of this Ordinance , all transfers of Use and Occupancy Deeds shall be recorded with the Tribal Clerk. The failure to record a transfer which took place prior to the effective date of this Ordinance is not a basis to declare a transfer invalid. (h) Use and Occupancy Deeds may not be transferred to a non-member or non-Indian in any manner, and the Tribe reserves the right to declare invalid such a transfer. 8. Land Contracts . A land contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller for the purchase of a right to use and occupy a parcel of land where the buyer makes installment payments to the seller for the eventual conveyance of the Tribal Use and Occupancy Deed or right to occupy the property. The following shall be considered in assessing the validity of a Land Contract: (a) The agreement may be informal, but must be written. (b) The agreement shall provide that a buyer will receive a deed to the property when all of the conditions of the contract have been satisfied. (c) Each contract will differ, but many land contracts provide that the buyer may occupy and make improvements to the land, even though the complete right to use and occupy is not transferred until the land contract is fulfilled. Once executed, a land contract may be filed with the Tribal Clerk's office to provide notice to the community at large. If there are multiple land contracts the Tribal Court must have a hearing to determine which land contract takes precedence. (d) Upon the effective date of this Ordinance , to validate the final conveyance of the right to use and occupy property and to ensure the Tribe's Land Records are accurate and current, once a land contract is fulfilled, and if it was not previously recorded it shall be recorded with the Tribal Clerk and a Use and Occupancy Deed shall then be issued. The failure to record a contract that was fulfilled prior to the effective date of this Ordinance shall not be a basis to declare the contract invalid. (e) If the buyer defaults under the terms of the contract, the seller may seek to evict the buyer through a claim in Tribal Court, if necessary, and may keep the installment payments and any improvements thereon, unless the buyer can demonstrate to the Court's satisfaction that to return the land with the improvement along with keeping monies paid would result in the seller's unjust enrichment. The Tribal Court must have a hearing to determine if the buyer is entitled to any compensation. The Tribal Court must state its findings in a written order. 9. Bill of Sale . A Bill of Sale is a record of a purchase transaction between individuals for the exchange of their right to use and occupy a particular parcel of land and may stand as a deed conveying the right to use and occupy the property under tribal law. The following shall be considered in assessing a Bill of Sale: (a) As of the effective date of this Ordinance , the Bill of Sale must be signed, witnessed or notarized and then recorded with the Tribal Clerk in order to be a valid transfer of the right to use and occupy property. (b) In the past, Bills of Sale were not always recorded with the Tribal Clerk. In the event the Bill of Sale was not recorded, the Bill of Sale will be considered a binding document evincing an intent to transfer the right to use and occupy a property in the same manner as a deed, unless there is evidence expressly contrary to that intent. (c) In the instance that there are two Bills of Sale for one particular property, the Bill of Sale dated first will supersede any and all other Bills of Sale unless it can be shown to be invalid. A Bill of Sale may only be deemed invalid by the Tribal Court if there is evidence of fraud, deceit, coercion or duress in the transfer made in the Bill of Sale or in the signing of the document. The party challenging the Bill of Sale has the burden of proof to show with clear and convincing evidence that a document is invalid. 10. Survey of Tribal Lands . (a) For those transfers of property where a survey is required, the parties may either provide the survey themselves, subject to the approval of the Tribal Clerk, or the Tribal Clerk may provide assistance in obtaining a survey. The Tribal Clerk shall set a fee schedule for the cost of a survey, to be approved by the Tribal Council. For those Tribal Members who cannot afford a survey, they can submit a request to Tribal Clerk or his/her designee for a fee waiver, subject to availability of resources. The Tribal Clerk shall determine, based upon established guidelines, who shall be eligible for such a waiver. (b) Property transferred on the Reservation must be properly described with boundaries that are clearly delineated, measurable and not in dispute. As of the effective date of this Ordinance , a survey by a licensed surveyor is required for all parcels of land transferred on the Reservation unless: (1) there is an existing survey of the subject parcel that is less than ten (10) years old; or (2) the parties and any affected adjacent landowners enter into a boundary line agreement that provides an accurate description of the property being transferred, and the parties agree in writing that a survey is not necessary and they agree to be bound to the property description; or (3) the transfer is a family transfer and does not change the existing boundaries of the property, unless the Tribal Clerk deems it necessary. If the Tribal Clerk deems a survey necessary none shall be required if the affected adjacent landowners enter into a boundary line agreement. (c) Surveys for disputed land parcels: (1) If a parcel is not surveyed prior to a transfer and a dispute arises as to boundaries described within the transferring document, the parties to the transaction or adjacent landowners agree to be bound by an impartial survey by a third party, unless the transferring document is so ambiguous that the surveyor cannot complete the survey. In that instance, the Tribal Court shall be empowered to decide how the boundaries shall be surveyed, based on evidence presented in a Tribal Court proceeding. (2) In resolving boundary disputes, the Tribal Court may not rely on GIS or other data to determine property boundaries. The parties shall provide the Court with surveys performed by licensed surveyors to support any claims regarding boundary lines provided that, in the case of ambiguity in a deed and relying on common law principles in drawing property boundaries, the Court may issue instructions to resolve an ambiguity so that a proper survey may be performed. If neither party presents a survey to the Court in a boundary dispute or in a case involving property lines, the Court may order a survey and assess the cost to the party or parties in its discretion. V. LAND DISPUTE CLAIM PROCEDURES A. Tribal Court Jurisdiction. 1. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court shall have jurisdiction over land disputes. The Tribal Court shall have the authority to award monetary damages and equitable relief, provided however, that the Tribal Council retains the sole authority to issue, revise, or rescind a Use and Occupancy Deed. The Tribal Council is bound by any Tribal Court Order regarding land disputes, and failure to obey such orders shall subject the Tribe, but not the individual Council Members acting in their official capacity, to equitable or injunctive relief, as necessary to enforce the Order. 2. Tribal Court shall have jurisdiction over any land dispute that is commenced within six years of accrual of the injury or the date the party knew or should have known of the injury that serves as the basis of the claim. The Tribal Court has the discretion to waive the statute of limitations for good cause, such as where the party could not have known or was prevented from knowing of his or her injury. B. Capacity to File a Dispute. A land dispute may be filed by: 1. Any enrolled Tribal Member; 2. A non-member on behalf of his or her minor, mentally or physically handicapped and dependent child(ren) or family member, as long as the child(ren) or family member is/are Tribally-enrolled; or 3. A non-member spouse who may seek a life estate after the death of his or her Member spouse. C. Information Required. A Land Dispute Complaint shall contain the following information: 1. A Statement of the nature of the dispute, e.g. boundary line, title, ownership; 2. Names of all other Interested Parties, including Claimant and Respondent and their connection to the dispute and the reason for each party's interest; and 3. Copies of any relevant documents which may be required to address the dispute and which will inform the Court and the parties about the facts, including, but not limited to, Wills, Deeds, Use and Occupancy Deeds, Tribal Council Decisions, Surveys, Bills of Sale or any other relevant correspondence, or receipts. D. Public Notice. 1. Within ten (10) days following the filing of the Claim, the Tribal Court Clerk shall publish a Notice which shall start the thirty-day (30) Public Notice Period. The Notice shall state: PUBLIC NOTICE OF LAND DISPUTE Any Person having any interest whatsoever or information pertaining to this matter shall have thirty (30) business days from the date of publication of this Notice to file opposing or related claims or to provide relevant information to the Court. Information and related claims should be filed no later than _________________, 20 _______. 2. The Notice shall also contain the following information: (a) Name and address of the Claimant; (b) Name and address of Respondent; (c) Address or other information regarding the location of the property in dispute; (d) Claim file number; (e) A brief description of the nature of the dispute. 3. The Notice shall appear in at least one weekly Akwesasne community newspaper and on the Official Tribal Website at www.srmt-nsn.gov. The Public Notice shall be published for two consecutive weeks and shall also be displayed at the Tribal Community Building. The cost of the notice shall be born by the Claimant as provided for in the Court fee schedule. E. Confidentiality. Any material provided to the Court during this process also will be provided to all Interested Parties. However, any documentation that could be considered private or confidential, including but not limited to social security number, date of birth or other information used as identity, shall be segregated from the case file and may be viewed only by the Court, the Claimant, and the Respondent unless a release is signed by the affected party. F. Applicable Laws and Rules. All Tribal Laws, including those pertaining to procedures before the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court shall govern the land dispute claims filed in Tribal Court. If there is an apparent conflict of Laws, the Tribal Court shall seek to read the Laws in a way that they will work together. But, to the extent there is a conflict, this Ordinance shall take precedence in relation to land and land disputes. G. Review of Prior Tribal Council Land Dispute Decisions. 1. As a matter of equity, the statute of limitations will be waived and the Tribal Court shall have the authority to review any land dispute decisions made by Tribal Council between December 1, 1998 and December 3, 2009 (the original Effective Date of the prior Land Dispute Ordinance). Such review shall be de novo. This authority shall expire on June 30, 2018. 2. As of December 3, 2009, the Tribal Council no longer had authority to resolve land disputes. If, between December 4, 2009, and the date of the adoption of this Ordinance , the Tribal Council took action on a land dispute despite this bar, the party seeking to file a claim regarding such action must first establish that Tribal Council actually resolved a land dispute as defined herein before a claim may be brought. The Tribal Court shall have the discretion to waive the statute of limitations regarding a land dispute in such case, but in no instance, may the Tribal Council or Tribe be named as a party except as permitted under this Ordinance . Tribal Court shall not entertain cases where the Tribal Council simply executed a Use and Occupancy Deed. H. Review of Prior Land Tribunal Cases 1. All cases filed with but not finally resolved by the Land Dispute Tribunal under the prior Ordinance shall be transferred to the Tribal Court to be heard under this Ordinance . No additional filing fee shall be required. The Court shall provide written notice to each party in each pending matter. 2. All cases that were previously filed under the prior Ordinance with the Land Dispute Tribunal that resulted in final decisions from the Land Dispute Tribunal or for which appeals have been exhausted may not be filed in, nor reheard by, the Tribal Court. I. Appeals. All final decisions of the Tribal Court regarding land or land disputes shall be appealable to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Appellate Court. VI. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY NOT WAIVED The Tribal Council agrees to a limited waiver of its immunity solely for the Tribal Court to review any decisions the Tribal Council rendered on land disputes as defined in Sec. III.F. , to hear any claim in which the Tribe claims title or an ownership interest in property which is in dispute, or to hear a claim regarding the correction of a deed. The waiver shall apply to equitable remedies only. Otherwise, nothing in this Ordinance is intended nor shall be construed as any other waiver of the sovereign immunity of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe from suit in State, Federal or Tribal Court against the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, any Tribal entity, or any official acting in his or her official capacity. VII. AMENDMENT This Ordinance may be amended upon the approval of such amendments by the majority of Tribal Council and upon notice to the Tribal membership. VIII. REPEALER This Ordinance shall supersede and replace all prior Ordinances, or portions thereof, adopted by the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, as they pertain to the matters contained herein. IX. SEVERABILITY The provisions of this Ordinance are severable and if any part or provision shall be held void by any Court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of the Court so holding shall not affect or impair any of the remaining parts or provisions of this Ordinance .

Purpose The purpose of this law is (1) to provide a fair and equitable orderly distribution of estates; (2) clarify tribal law concerning estates; (3) promote a speedy and efficient system for administering estates; and (4) empower the application of Tribal Law including sovereignty, culture, customs and values of the Tribe. This Probate Law shall be liberally construed and applied. Section 1.2. Definitions (a) \"Administrator\" means the person appointed by the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court to administer the estate of a person who dies without having executed a valid Last Will and Testament (\"Will\"). (b) \"Affidavit\" is a written, notarized statement, signed by the party making the statement and contains the following oath: \"I hereby swear under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true to the best of my belief and knowledge.\" (c) \"Beneficiary\" means any person entitled to take or share in the deceased's estate as provided for under this law . A \"beneficiary by law\" also known as an \"heir\" or \"distributee\" is one who is entitled to share in an estate because of a legal relationship with the deceased and usually when there is no Will. A \"beneficiary by will\" is one who may not necessarily have a legal relationship to the deceased but who is entitled to share in an estate because of the terms of a Will. (d) \"Deceased's Estate\" or \"Estate\" means real property (land) and personal property (everything other than real property, e.g. moveable items for which a transfer of title is needed) which the deceased owned at the time of his or her death, including interests in property acquired during a marriage. (e) \"Executor\" means the person designated in the deceased's Will to administer the deceased's estate or who is appointed by the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court to administer the estate. (f) \"Heir\" means a person recognized as being entitled to share in an estate based on a relationship to the deceased, also known as a \"beneficiary by law\" in this Law . (g) \"Probate\" means the legal process under tribal law by which a deceased's estate is distributed and which includes: determining heirs and beneficiaries; determining the validity of a Will, if any; and determining whether there are valid claims against the estate. Probate will result in the issuance of a final order distributing the estate. (h) \"Real property\" means all interests in land or in buildings or improvements permanently attached to land. Reservation land which is held by a tribal member through a use and occupancy deed issued by the Tribe or other written instrument is a \"possessory interest\" in real property, which means the person has a right to possess the land under tribal law. A possessory interest is real property under this law . (i) \"Reservation\" means both the Saint Regis Mohawk Indian Tribe Reservation as established by the 1796 Treaty with the Seven Nations of Canada (7 Stat. 55) and any other lands over which the Tribe exercises jurisdiction now or in the future. (j) \"Tribal Clerk\" means the elected official responsible for, among other things, administering tribal land records. See Tribal Clerk Act, TCR 2003-115 and any future amendments. (k) \"Tribal Court\" means the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court. (l) \"Tribal Member\" means an enrolled member of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. (m) \"Tribe\" means the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. (n) \"Willmaker\" is a person who makes a Will. Section 1.3. Jurisdiction (a) Personal Jurisdiction. Tribal Court shall have personal jurisdiction to probate an estate when, at the time of death, (1) the deceased was either a Tribal Member or a person eligible for enrollment as a Tribal Member and the deceased resided or owned real or personal property located within the Reservation or (2) the non-member spouse of a Tribal Member who resided on and owned personal property located within the Reservation or (3) anyone who consents to the Tribal Court's jurisdiction. (b) Subject Matter Jurisdiction. (1) The Tribal Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to probate real property located within the Reservation. (2) The Tribal Court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with any other judicial proceedings in which the deceased's estate is involved as permitted by federal law or other applicable law. (c) Ancillary Probate/Administration. When at time of death a decedent resided in a foreign state or foreign county and he/she had a Will then his/her executor may file a petition for ancillary probate in Tribal Court when the decedent held real property on the Reservation or owned other personal property over which the Tribal Court would have jurisdiction; if there is no Will then his/her heir may file for ancillary administration in Tribal Court when the decedent held real property on the Reservation or owned other personal property over which the Tribal Court would have jurisdiction. (d) Powers . The Tribal Court shall have authority to: (1) appoint Administrators or Executors; (2) determine heirs and beneficiaries; (3) determine whether a Will is valid; (4) carry out the requirements of this Law ; and (5) issue any orders that may be consistent with and/or necessary to carry out the Court's authority. (e) Control of Funeral Arrangements. Control of funeral arrangements and disposition of the remains of the deceased shall be based upon a decision of the family and the traditional customs of the Tribe. (f) Distribution of Culturally Significant Items. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Probate Law relating to descent and distribution, the surviving spouse or other surviving next of kin may distribute any item of cultural or religious significance belonging to the deceased in accordance with the customs and traditions of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe without having to wait for the resolution of an estate in Tribal Court, provided however, that if a Will or instructions were left by the deceased, such distribution shall be in accordance with those instructions. The Tribal Court may exercise jurisdiction over claims that those directions were not followed. (g) Nation Practices. The Tribal Court acknowledges that the traditional Longhouses use their own process to distribute the property of deceased members. The Tribal Court may recognize evidence of a distribution from a 10 Day Feast and may hear from traditional Longhouse members regarding the 10 Day Feast. Section 1.4. Records and Certified Copies (a) Record of Reservation Land Interests. The Tribal Clerk is required to keep a record of the transfer of land interests on the Reservation. The Tribal Court, therefore, shall serve upon the Tribal Clerk all orders or decisions, if any, relating to the identification of heirs and beneficiaries, and transfer or distribution of land on the Reservation for recording in the tribal land registry. (b) Estate Files. Once an estate is closed, the Tribal Court shall retain all records related to the deceased's estate and facilitate access to these records upon request. If copies are requested, the Tribal Court may set a fee for the copying and certification of such records. Section 1.5. False Statements and Fraud (a) Signatures . When a person signs and files any document with the Tribal Court, the Court will assume that the signature indicates the person swears to the truth of the filing or document as far as that person knows or is informed. The signature also indicates that person understands that penalties for perjury can be imposed if the document contains a deliberate falsehood. (b) Fraudulent Conduct. If a person engages in fraudulent conduct during a probate proceeding, anyone harmed by that conduct may bring an action for damages or other remedies against the person carrying out the fraud and against anyone who has benefitted from the fraud whether innocent or not. A claim for fraud will be barred unless commenced within five years after the discovery of the fraud. This section does not apply to any fraud that may have been committed against a deceased during his/her lifetime and which may affect the distribution of the estate. Section 1.6. Fiduciary Duty (a) Duty Defined . Any person appointed as Administrator or Executor has a fiduciary duty to uphold this law and follow the orders of the Tribal Court. As a fiduciary, the Administrator or Executor shall act honestly and in good faith, expeditiously and efficiently, and consistent with the best interests of the estate. It is assumed that all persons are capable of carrying out their fiduciary duties unless such person has been convicted of a Serious Crime. \"Serious Crime\" shall have the same meaning as the term is defined in the Tribal Ethics Ordinance. (b) Liability . If the Administrator or Executor has improperly exercised his/her power concerning the estate or failed to carry out his/her fiduciary duty, the Administrator or Executor may be held liable for breach of trust. The Administrator or Executor cannot be held liable if the conduct at issue was authorized or if he/she followed the orders of the Tribal Court, even if those orders are later reversed. Section 1.7. Service If no method of service is provided within this Law then the Tribal Court Rules of Civil Procedure regarding service of pleadings shall apply. CHAPTER 2 ACTION UPON DEATH Section 2.1. General Guidelines for Estate Distribution and Small Estates (a) Persons without a Will. The procedure in Chapter 3 will apply for distribution of an estate without a Will. (b) Persons with a Will . The procedure in Chapter 4 will apply for distribution of an estate with a Will. (c) Small Estates . (1) Basis for Using Small Estate Process. If a person dies and leaves an estate whose value is less than $20,000.00 and which does not include any interests in real property, the estate may be settled with minimal Tribal Court involvement so long as all of the heirs and beneficiaries agree to small estate administration and have signed a written waiver of their right to contest the estate. This may also include probate of personal property that is discovered from an estate that was informally probated prior to the enactment of this Law . (2) Petition for Small Estate. For qualifying estates, an heir or the surviving spouse shall file an affidavit in Tribal Court which provides the following information: (A) A death certificate, record or some evidence to establish deceased's status; (B) the estimated value of the estate and the basis of that estimate; (C) a list of all known heirs; (D) a family tree obtained from the Tribal Clerk; (E) a written Will, if any; (F) a list of known debts to be paid from the estate; and (G) waiver from each heir and beneficiary consenting to the small estate administration. (3) Contents of Affidavit. The affidavit shall include a request that the estate be settled informally without having to admit the estate to probate along with the written consent of all heirs to the procedure. The affidavit may set forth the proposed estate distribution. (4) Requesting Party. If there is no surviving spouse, any of the deceased's next of kin or, if there is no next of kin, any suitable person whom the Tribal Court deems to have a sufficient interest may make the application. (5) No Administrator. It shall not be necessary to appoint an Administrator if the value of the deceased's property appears to be less than $20,000.00 in value, there is no real property, no heir or beneficiary objects, and no one requests that one be appointed. (6) Court Duty. Upon finding an estate qualifies for a small estate administration, the Tribal Court shall issue such orders and other documents as may be required for a small estate. It shall proceed as a small estate as long as no heir or beneficiary objects to it. (d) Limited Administration. If a person dies and his/her heirs and/or beneficiaries need certain limited relief that cannot await full probate of the estate the Tribal Court may allow heirs, beneficiaries, creditors, the Tribe, or other interested party to obtain a special appointment with notice to heirs to address that limited purpose. Tribal Court shall develop a petition for such purpose, determine each case for a limited appointment in its discretion and shall set limits in its order of appointment. The order of appointment shall be recorded in the Tribal Clerk's office in the same manner as outlined in Section 3.5(b) . If there is a subsequent estate that is probated, the limited administration and whatever action was taken shall be included in the decedent's inventory of assets. The Tribal Court's decision regarding a limited appointment is not considered a final decision for purposes of an appeal. (e) Renouncing a Share of an Estate. (1) Affidavit. A person who is an heir or a beneficiary by law or by Will may renounce in whole or in part the right to any estate property or interest. In order to renounce an interest or share of an estate, the person must file an affidavit with the Tribal Court not later than three (3) months after the deceased's death or the time at which it is determined that the person is entitled to take property. (2) Court Action. The affidavit shall describe the property or interest being renounced and the extent of the renunciation. It shall be signed under oath by the person renouncing the interest. If the Court accepts the affidavit then, when applying the rules of inheritance, the Court shall treat the person renouncing the interest or share of the estate as having predeceased the deceased and the interest or share shall pass according to intestacy rules. (f) Effect of Homicide on Beneficiaries. (1) Heir. A surviving spouse, heir or beneficiary who is found to have criminally and intentionally killed the deceased is not entitled to any benefits passing under this law and the estate of the deceased shall pass as if the killer had predeceased the deceased. (2) Right of Survivorship. Any person with a right of survivorship in personal or real property who criminally and intentionally kills a joint owner, joint tenant, or any other form of co-ownership has no rights by survivorship. This provision applies to joint tenancies in real and personal property, joint accounts in banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and other institutions, and any other form of co-ownership with survivorship rights. (3) Beneficiaries. A named beneficiary of a bond, life insurance policy or other contractual arrangement who criminally and intentionally kills the person upon whose life the policy is issued is not entitled to any benefit under the bond, policy or other contractual arrangement, and it becomes payable as though the killer had predeceased the deceased. (4) Other. Any other acquisition of property or interest from an estate by the killer shall be treated in accordance with the principles of this section. (5) Judgment. A final judgment of conviction of an offense containing the elements of criminal and intentional killing is conclusive for purposes of this section. In the absence of a conviction of criminal and intentional killing, the Tribal Court may determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the killing was criminal and intentional for purposes of this section. (g) Simultaneous Death . In some cases, title to property or the transfer of property depends upon an individual surviving the death of another person. An individual shall be deemed to have survived the other person if it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the other person by 120 hours. If it cannot be established by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the deceased by 120 hours, then that individual is deemed to have been predeceased. Section 2.2. Evidence as to Death In order to distribute an estate, the death of the estate owner must be proved as part of any proceeding. The Tribal Court may accept the following evidence to confirm proof of death: (a) Death Certificate. A certified or authenticated copy of a death certificate issued by an official or agency with the authority to issue a death certificate at the place where the death purportedly occurred is proof of the fact, place, date and time of death and the identity of the deceased. (b) Record . A certified or authenticated copy of any record or report of a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, that a person is missing, detained, dead or alive, is proof of the status and of the dates, circumstances and places disclosed by the record or report. (c) Other Evidence . The person seeking to establish the death has the burden of producing the required documentation. The Court shall accept a Funeral Director's Certificate of Death. The Court may also, in its discretion, consider other evidence including an affidavit of next of kin of the deceased which sets forth the date and circumstances of the death, any supporting documentation, and the reason no government records are available. (d) Absence . A person who is absent for a continuous period of five (5) years, during which he/she has not been heard from, and whose absence is not satisfactorily explained after diligent search or inquiry is presumed to be dead. His/her death is presumed to have occurred at the end of the period unless there is sufficient evidence for determining that death occurred earlier. CHAPTER 3 DISTRIBUTION OF AN ESTATE WITHOUT A WILL (INTESTATE) Section 3.1. Petition for Court Action (a) Initiation of Process by Petition . When a Tribal Member or non-member spouse of a Tribal Member dies without a Will and leaves an estate which falls under the jurisdiction of the Tribal Court, any Tribal Member who is an heir of the deceased may file a petition for probate of the estate. In a probate proceeding, the Tribal Court shall identify the heirs or beneficiaries by law and determine whether there are valid claims against the estate. Probate will then result in the issuance of a final order distributing the deceased's assets. (b) Petition Requirements . The petition shall meet the following requirements: (1) Contents. The petition will be in writing, signed by the petitioner, and include a death certificate or some other proof of death as set forth in Section 2.2 . (2) Proof of Court Authority. The petition must provide information establishing the deceased was: (A) a Tribal Member who resided on the Reservation or owned real or personal property on the Reservation; (B) a non-member spouse who resided on the Reservation and owned personal property on the Reservation; or (C) any other person who consents to the Court's jurisdiction. (3) Identification of Heirs. The petition must state the names of the heirs of the deceased, if known, and include a Family Tree as certified by the Tribal Clerk. Section 3.2. Estate Distribution Principles for an Estate Without a Will (a) Court Order . In determining the heirs of an estate, the Tribal Court shall rely upon the information provided in the petition and the Family Tree and shall issue an order identifying those persons entitled under tribal law to share in the estate according to the principles set forth in this Ordinance. (b) Order of Inheritance . When a Tribal Member dies without leaving a Will, the following order of inheritance shall apply: (1) Surviving Spouse. A surviving Tribal Member spouse shall inherit the real property interest in Reservation land and all other property owned by the deceased spouse. A non- member spouse may only inherit a life estate in real property as provided for in Section 5.1 below but may inherit all of a deceased Member's personal property. A person who is divorced from the deceased or whose marriage to the deceased has been officially annulled is not considered a surviving spouse unless, by virtue of a subsequent marriage, he/she is married to the deceased at the time of death. A decree of separation, which does not terminate the status of husband and wife, is not a divorce for purposes of this Probate Law . (2) Children. If there is no surviving Tribal Member spouse, the surviving Tribal Member children shall each receive equal shares in the real property of the estate. All children shall share in the personal property of the estate. (3) Grandchildren. If there is no surviving Tribal Member spouse or surviving Tribal Member children of the deceased, surviving Tribal Member grandchildren shall each receive equal shares of the real property and all grandchildren shall share in the personal property of the estate. (4) Minors. In any case where minor Tribal Members may be entitled to an interest in real property, the land shall be held in trust by a legal guardian until they reach the age of majority, which is eighteen (18) years old. In any case where minors may be entitled to an interest in personal property that is sold the proceeds of the sale shall be held in trust until they reach the age of majority. (5) Parents. If there is no surviving spouse or descendants, the surviving Tribal Member parent(s) of the deceased shall each receive equal shares of the real property and any parent(s) shall share in personal property of the estate. (6) Siblings. In the event that a deceased Tribal member has no surviving Tribal Member spouse, children, grandchildren, or parents, the surviving Tribal Member's brothers and sisters shall each receive equal interests in the real property and shall share in the personal property of the estate. (7) Nieces/Nephew. In the event that a deceased Tribal Member has no surviving Tribal Member spouse, children, grandchildren, parents or siblings, the surviving children of the deceased Tribal Member's siblings, if any, shall each receive an equal interest in the real property and shall share in the personal property of the estate. (8) Aunts/Uncles. In the event that a deceased Tribal Member has no surviving Tribal Member spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, siblings or nieces and nephews then the surviving brothers and sisters of the parents of the deceased Tribal Member (aunts and uncles) shall each receive an equal interest in the real property and shall share in the personal property of the estate. (9) Divorce. The divorce of a husband and wife does not affect the right of their children to inherit from a deceased parent's property. (10) No Beneficiary. If there is no qualified beneficiary as outlined above, the estate shall pass to the Tribe. (c) Agreement on Plan for Distribution . If all of the heirs agree in writing on a plan for distribution different than set out in this Ordinance, the plan may be presented to the Tribal Court for approval and the Court shall exercises its discretion in whether to approve the plan based on fairness and equity. If the heirs have not agreed to a plan, the Tribal court shall apply the rules under tribal law for ownership and distribution to the heirs. If Tribal Members and non-members are to share in an estate that includes Tribal Land, because the Tribal Land cannot be distributed to the non-member, the Tribal Court shall determine the extent to which the value of a Tribal Member's share of land should be counted towards the overall distribution of the estate. Tribal Court shall make such a determination in writing. Section 3.3. Determination of Relationship of Parent and Child When necessary in the case of a person dying without a Will the relationship of parent and child shall be governed by the following principles: (a) Posthumous Birth . A person conceived before the deceased's death but born thereafter shall inherit as if he/she had been born in the lifetime of the deceased. (b) Adopted Person . A person who is legally adopted in a court of competent jurisdiction is treated as the natural child of an adopting parent. (c) Non-Marital Child Status. (1) Maternal. A non-marital child is the child of his/her mother so that he/she inherits from both mother and maternal relatives. (2) Paternal. A non-marital child is the child of his/her father so that he/she inherits from his/her father and paternal relatives if: (A) during the lifetime of the father a court of competent jurisdiction has issued a paternity order; or (B) the father of the child has signed a document acknowledging paternity. The document must have been signed in the presence of one or more witnesses and before a notary public or other officer and must have been filed within 60 days of signature with the putative father registry established under tribal or state law; or (C) after a court hearing, paternity can be established by clear and convincing evidence, which may include, but is not limited to: (i) evidence derived from a genetic marker test, or (ii) evidence that the father openly and notoriously acknowledged the child as his own, or (iii) other documentary evidence, including but not limited to, a birth certificate. (3) Agreement of Support. The existence of an agreement obligating the father to support the non-marital child does not mean the child is qualified to inherit from the father. (4) Non-Marital Child Inheritance. If a non-marital child dies, his/her relatives succeed to an inheritance as if the deceased was a marital child, provided that the father and the paternal relatives may inherit only if the paternity of the non-marital child can be established and if there is an Order of Support that the father have no arrears. (d) Other Children. Stepchildren and foster children and their descendants do not inherit unless adopted as recognized by Tribal Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction. Section 3.4. Appointment of Administrator (a) General . In all cases other than Small Estates, the Tribal Court shall appoint an Administrator. (b) Request for Appointment . A person seeking appointment as the Administrator must file an application with the Tribal Court along with a filing fee to be determined by the Tribal Court. The application shall set forth the petitioner's relationship to the deceased and the applicant's tribal enrollment status. The applicant must also provide written consents, if any, from each heir to his/her appointment as Administrator. The Application, Family Tree and Consent Forms shall all be promulgated by the Court and may be amended from time to time. (c) Who May Be Appointed . Any Tribal Member may apply to be appointed as administrator. The following persons, if legally competent, shall be appointed in this priority order: the surviving spouse; any child of the deceased who is over eighteen (18) years of age; any other blood relative in order of their closeness of relationship; or any other adult Tribal Member. In the rare circumstance where there is no enrolled Tribal Member able to assume the responsibility of Administrator, the Tribal Court may appoint a qualified third party, who may be a non-member who shall consent to the jurisdiction of Tribal Court. (d) Executor Acting as Administrator . When a Will does not dispose of all the deceased's property, that omitted property shall pass according to the provisions of this chapter and the Executor appointed in the Will may act as the Administrator to distribute the property with the rest of the estate. (e) Hearing . If all heirs have consented to the applicant serving as Administrator, the Tribal Court shall grant the application without a hearing. If all of the heirs do not consent, then the Tribal Court shall schedule a hearing within thirty (30) days of the application being filed. The Tribal Court shall serve all of the heirs with notice of the hearing. At the hearing, Tribal Court shall determine who should be appointed Administrator based upon a preponderance of the evidence and the estate's best interest. (f) Bond . If the value of the estate warrants it, the Tribal Court has the discretion to require that the Administrator file a bond in an amount to be set by the Tribal Court to insure his/her faithful, honest performance of his/her duties as Administrator. No bond shall be required of an Administrator who is the spouse or child of a deceased, unless evidence suggests it is necessary or desirable. (g) Oath . Upon appointment as Administrator, the person appointed shall take an oath prepared by the Tribal Court, to faithfully and honestly administer the estate. The oath may be taken in person at the Tribal Court or may be done in writing on a form prepared by the Tribal Court and which shall require that the Administrator's signature be notarized. Section 3.5. Order of Appointment as Administrator (a) Order . Once the Administrator takes the oath, the Tribal Court shall issue an Order of Appointment to the Administrator as proof of the appointment. Within seven (7) days, the Administrator shall provide a copy of the Order to the Tribal Clerk to be recorded either by delivering it in person or by certified mail. (b) Record of Order . The Tribal Clerk shall record the Order of Appointment as Administrator in the Tribal Recording Book, including a copy of the Order in the records. The Tribal Clerk shall note the Tribal Recording book number and page number on a copy of the Order and return it to the Administrator for his/her records. Section 3.6. Administrator Duties and Procedures (a) Preliminary expenses. The Administrator is required to pay for funeral expenses and any outstanding medical bills using the property of the estate, if available. The Administrator is not required to pay any expenses out of pocket. (b) Inventory . (1) List of Assets. The Administrator is required to take an inventory of all property and assets of the deceased. Assets may or may not include family heirlooms or items of sentimental value. This inventory shall be filed with Tribal Court within thirty (30) days after his/her appointment. The inventory should include an estimated value of all property and assets of the deceased. If an asset is of significant value, such as real property, an appraisal is recommended. The inventory should also indicate those items intended to be sold for the payment of debts or other estate requirements, if any. The Administrator shall provide a copy of this inventory to all persons with a known interest in the estate at the same time it is filed with the Court. (2) Advances. Property given to an heir during the deceased's lifetime shall not be treated as an advance against the heir's share of the estate unless the advance was declared in writing by the deceased or the heir at the time of the advance. Known advances should be listed in the inventory. (3) Objection to Inventory. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the inventory, any person with an interest in the estate may file an objection to the inventory or to the sale of any item in the inventory. (4) Hearing and Court Review. If objections to the inventory are filed, the Tribal Court shall schedule a hearing to be held within thirty (30) days. The Tribal Court shall notify all interested parties of the hearing. Upon consideration of the objections, the Tribal Court may order an amendment to the inventory or appraisal, or issue an order regarding the sale of property, as it deems just and proper to carry out the terms of the estate. (c) Creditors . (1) Identification. The Administrator is required to identify all creditors of the estate. To do so, the Administrator shall search the deceased's records for bills, notices, loan papers, and other documentation that suggests the deceased may have outstanding debts. The Administrator has the duty to contact all known creditors to determine amounts owed and the process for addressing bills and other debts. The Administrator shall also publish a public notice within thirty (30) days of appointment stating that all other creditors must present their claims to the Administrator and that only the claims presented may be considered for payment by the estate. The notice shall give the creditors thirty (30) days to respond and will clearly state the final date for claims to be presented. Unless there is a waiver or modification approved by the Court, the notice shall be posted on the Tribe's website, and published for three consecutive weeks in a publication of general distribution on the Reservation and if deemed necessary in the nearby towns of Massena and Malone. (2) Documentation. For those debts identified by the Administrator from the estate records, the Administrator shall prepare a list of the amounts owed and any necessary forms or documentation needed to resolve the debts and close accounts. Any other claims submitted by a creditor shall be presented in an affidavit and shall include documentation, such as writings or witness statements, as necessary for the Administrator and the Tribal Court to determine if the claim is valid. The creditor shall state under oath that its claim is justly due, that to the extent payments were made by the deceased they have been credited, and that it knows of no offsets against the claim. If a creditor fails to present a claim within the time period allowed, the creditor may request Tribal Court in its discretion allow it to file the claim directly with the Tribal Court at the same time the Administrator presents the creditors' claims under subsection (4) below. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied. (3) Administrator Review. Once the Administrator collects the creditors' claims, the Administrator shall review them and shall notify the creditors as to whether they are accepted or rejected and explain the reasons for the decision. The Administrator is required to make a decision and provide notice within thirty (30) days of presentation of the claim. (4) Court Review. (A) The Administrator shall notify the Tribal Court as to whether any creditor claims have been presented. (B) If there are claims, the Administrator shall provide the Tribal Court with a list of claims with supporting documentation explaining whether the claim has been accepted or rejected. The Administrator must present this information to the Court no later than forty-five (45) days after the creditor claim period has closed. (C) Rejected creditors have ten (10) days to respond to the list filed with the Court. If after ten (10) days, no objections are filed, the Court may approve the list and the Administrator may pay the approved claims. If a rejected creditor files an objection, the Tribal Court shall determine the validity of the claim and the objection, relying on the affidavit or personal testimony of the claimant. If an objection is filed, the Administrator may pay creditors only after the Tribal Court issues an order regarding the validity of the claims. At no time, shall the Tribal Court permit the sale of Tribal Land to satisfy an estate's debts except if the claimant can show that the deceased expected his/her land to be sold to satisfy the outstanding debt. (5) Timing In sum, the time frame for Administrators as set forth in this law is as follows: (A) Inventory. Within thirty (30) days after appointment, the Administrator will present an estate inventory to the Tribal Court. Objections to the inventory are to be filed with the Tribal Court no later than thirty (30) days thereafter. If objections are filed, the Tribal Court must hold a hearing within thirty (30) days. (B) Creditor's Claims. Within thirty (30) days after appointment, the Administrator must publish a public notice asking for creditors to bring forth their claims. A Creditor will have thirty (30) days from the date of the last public notice to file a claim with the Administrator. The Administrator will have thirty (30) days from the filing of the claim to decide whether to recognize the creditor's claim. If claims are filed or debts are identified, the Administrator must file a list of claims with the Tribal Court within forty-five (45) days after the claim period closes. Rejected creditors have ten (10) days to file with the Tribal Court documentation explaining why they should be paid. (d) Distribution of Estate. The Administrator is responsible for distributing the estate once heirs are identified and the creditors, if any, have been identified. (1) Creditors. All verified claims of creditors allowed by the Tribal Court and identified debts shall be paid before distribution of the estate to the heirs. (2) Accounting. Before distributing the estate to the heirs, the Administrator must provide the Tribal Court with an accounting of the estate assets for approval. The accounting will show all disbursements made for expenses and creditors, and shall include receipts. The accounting will also show the computation of any attorney's and/or Administrator's fees for which approval is sought. The accounting will set out the remaining estate to be distributed and contain a statement that the estate is ready to be distributed to the heirs. The accounting may include a signed consent form from each heir to the proposed distribution from the estate. (3) Advances. When distributing property among the heirs, any property that was advanced is valued at the time the heir came into possession of the property. (4) Administrator Fee. If an Administrator requests a fee, the Tribal Court shall establish the percentage for compensation on a case by case basis, but in no event shall the percentage be more than five (5%) percent of the total value of the gross estate. (e) Order Approving Distribution and Closing of Estate. (1) Order of Distribution. When the Tribal Court is satisfied that an estate is ready to be distributed and the Administrator has set out the plan for distribution in the accounting, the Tribal Court shall issue an order approving the distribution. (2) Closing of Estate. Once the estate is distributed, the Administrator shall file a statement with the Tribal Court stating that the estate is fully administered and ready to be closed, with receipts showing that the estate is fully distributed. Upon receipt of this statement, the estate shall be closed, the Administrator of the estate shall be dismissed, and if applicable, his/her bond shall be released. (f) Reopening an Estate . An estate may be reopened in the following circumstances: (1) Discovery of Will. If an estate has passed through probate on the assumption that a Will does not exist, but a Will is later discovered, the estate may be reopened so long as the petition to reopen is filed within sixty (60) days of discovery of the Will. An estate may only be reopened within two years of the final order closing the estate and only in extraordinary circumstances. In no instance may property be re-claimed by a newly identified heir if the property has been sold or transferred to a third party (bona fide purchaser). (2) Discovery of Property. If property is discovered after an estate has been closed, the estate may be reopened to dispose of the property. The Tribal Court shall order distribution of the property to the person or persons entitled thereto after issuing whatever orders are necessary to assure a just participation of the after-discovered property in the expenses of the estate. CHAPTER 4 DISTRIBUTION OF ESTATES SUBJECT TO A WILL (TESTATE) Section 4.1. Requirements for a Valid Will (a) Applicable Law . A written Will may be declared valid if it was executed in compliance with this Probate Law ; or the law in force at the place and time the Will was executed; or the law in force at the time of execution or at the time of death, at the place where the person making the Will was domiciled or had a place of abode. (b) Qualification to Make a Will. Any person eighteen (18) or more years of age who is of sound mind may make a Will. To be effective, a Will must be declared valid by the process provided for in this law . (c) Requirements for a Will and Signature . (1) Will in Writing. Every Will shall be in writing and the document shall declare that it is the last Will of the person making the Will. (2) Signature. Every Will must be signed by the person making the will along with two witnesses. If the person making the Will is unable to sign, some other person may be designated to sign the Will on the Willmaker's behalf so long as the signature takes place in the presence and by the direction of the person making the Will and in the presence of two witnesses. (3) Witnesses. At least two people must attest to the signature on the Will. Each witness shall attest that he/she witnessed the Willmaker sign the Will or witnessed the Willmaker acknowledge the signature placed on the Will at his/her direction. (d) Who May Witness a Will . (1) Qualification. Any person who would be found competent to testify as a witness in Court to the facts relating to the signature on the Will may act as a witness. (2) Interested Party. A Will or any provision thereof is not invalid because the Will is signed by a party with an interest in the Will, so long as the Will is also signed by two other disinterested witnesses. An \"Interested Witness\" means any of the following: (A) an heir; (B) a beneficiary; (C) a person named as Executor; or (D) a person named as Executor in the Will of the deceased. (e) Self-Proved Will. (1) Self-Proved Will Generally. In order to be declared valid in court, the Will's beneficiaries will be required to bring forth evidence of the validity of the Will. Each witness must attest that in the presence of each other and the Willmaker he/she witnessed: (1) the Willmaker was of full age, sound mind and memory; (2) Willmaker declared it to be his Last Will and Testament and (3) it was signed voluntarily. To simplify the process of proving a Will, the person making the Will may self-prove it at the time of execution or at a later time by signing an Acknowledgement of the Will statement. (2) Acknowledgement Form. The acknowledgement must be attached to the Will in form and content substantially as follows, shall be signed by the person making the Will and the witnesses, and then shall be notarized. Akwesasne Territory Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Reservation State of New York Acknowledgement of Signature on Will We, _____________________, _____________________, the witnesses to the Will, and, being first duly sworn, do hereby declare to the undersigned authority that [name of person making Will] signed, declared and executed the document as his/her last Will and that he/she signed willingly or directed another to sign for him, and that he/she executed it as his/her free and voluntary act for the purposes therein expressed; and that each of the witnesses, in the presence and hearing of [name of the person making the Will] , signed the Will as witness and that to the best of his/her knowledge [name of the person making the Will] , was at the time eighteen (18) or more years of age, of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence. ____________________________________ ____________________________________ Witness ____________________________________ Witness The aforesaid subscribing witnesses further state that this Acknowledgement was executed at the request of [WILLMAKER'S NAME], and that at the time of execution of this Acknowledgement, the original Will was exhibited to them and they identified it as such Will by their signature appearing as subscribing witnesses. Subscribed, sworn to and acknowledged before me by ____________________ and _________________, the witnesses to the Will, this _______ day of _____________________, 20_____. Signed _______________________________________ Notary Public (f) Non-conforming Wills. Wills made prior to the adoption of this Ordinance and not in conformity with these requirements may be considered valid unless the Tribal Court determines, based on information provided by witnesses, that the Will is not entitled to be recognized due to fraud or some other infirmity that makes the will suspect or does not meet common law requirements for a will. (g) Conveyances to Non-members are void. Will provisions which bequeath real property to a non-member are void as to those provisions, and the subject real property shall pass in accordance with the intestate provisions of this Ordinance, but other personal property may pass as bequeathed. Section 4.2. Rules for Interpreting a Will (a) Incorporation by Reference . Any writing in existence when a Will is signed may be incorporated by reference if the Will indicates that the writing should be incorporated and it describes the writing sufficiently to permit its identification. (b) Rules of Construction and Intention . The intention of a person making a Will as expressed in his/her Will controls the distribution of the estate. The rules of construction set forth in this Probate Law do not apply if they are contrary to the intention of the Will. (c) Will Passes All Property . A Will must be interpreted to pass all property of the estate, including property acquired after the execution of the Will. (d) Devises or Gifts and the Residual. (1) Residue Definition. The \"residue\" of an estate is what remains after fees and expenses are paid and specific devises, or devises of assets or cash are made. This part of the estate is also call the \"residual.\" (2) Specific Devise. Wills may provide for specific shares of real or personal property to specific beneficiaries. This is known as a specific devise. If a specific devise cannot be carried out for any reason, such as the beneficiary has predeceased the person making the Will, whatever was devised becomes a part of the residue of the estate. (3) Division of Residue. If the person making the Will provides that the residue of the estate passes to two or more persons and one of the shares cannot be passed to that person, his/her share will pass to the other beneficiaries of the residue in proportion to their interests. (e) Property Given During Lifetime. (1) Generally. If a beneficiary is given a gift of property by the person making the Will during the Willmaker's lifetime, that property will be not be treated as satisfaction of a devise or gift under the Will except as provided for in subsection (2) below. (2) Treatment as Devise. The gift may be treated as part of the beneficiary's inheritance if (A) the Will provides for the deduction of the gift, (B) the person making the Will declares in a separate writing at the time of the gift that it is in satisfaction of a devise, or (C) the beneficiary acknowledges in writing that the gift is in satisfaction of a devise. (3) Valuation. If the property is determined to be a devise as set forth in subparagraph (e)(2) above then such property given during the lifetime of the Willmaker shall be valued at the date the beneficiary came into possession or enjoyment of the property. (f) Children Left Out of a Will . If a Willmaker mistakenly leaves a child out of his/her Will, or fails to provide for any children born or adopted after the Will is signed, the child who has been left out shall receive a share in the estate equal in value to that which he would have received had the person died without a Will. In satisfying a share provided for in this section, the other devises made by the Will shall be reduced according to the rules governing the distribution of an estate in Section 4.8(d) . A child who is excluded, however, shall not receive a share if it appears from the Will that the child was left out intentionally or the person making the Will expressed the intention to and did provide for the child outside of the Will. The burden of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence and it shall be on the excluded child seeking a share of the estate. (g) Spouse Left Out of a Will. (1) If a Will fails to provide for a surviving spouse, that spouse would not receive a share if it appears from the Will that the spouse was left out intentionally or the person making the Will otherwise expressed the intention to provide for, and did provide for, the surviving spouse outside of the Will. (2) If a Will fails to provide for a surviving spouse who married the person making the Will after the Will was signed, the spouse shall receive the same share of the estate the spouse would have received if the deceased left no Will. In satisfying a share provided for in this section, the other devises made by the Will shall be reduced according to the rules governing the distribution of an estate in Section 4.8(d) . (3) The burden of proof in either case shall be by a preponderance of the evidence and the burden shall be on the excluded spouse seeking a share in the estate. Section 4.3. Rules Applicable to the Revocation of a Will (a) Revocation Generally. (1) Later Will or Supplement. A Will or any part thereof may be revoked by a second (or later) valid Will, or a supplemental document (codicil) which has been signed and witnessed and is attached to a Will. In order for the prior Will to be revoked, the second Will (or later) or supplemental document must expressly state it is revoking a prior Will or the terms of the subsequent will or supplemental document are clearly inconsistent. In that case, the later Will or document takes precedence. (2) Destruction. A Will or any part thereof may be revoked by destroying, canceling, or obliterating the Will with the intent and for the purpose of revoking it. If unable to carry out the action, a person making a Will may direct any other person in his/her presence to destroy, cancel or obliterate the Will. (3) Revival. Once a Will is revoked, it cannot be revived unless, upon revocation of a second or later Will, the person making the Will declares his/her intention to revive the first Will or the circumstances clearly show the intention to revive it. (b) Revocation and Divorce or Separation. (1) Divorce. If, after executing a Will, the person making the Will is divorced or the marriage is annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any transfer of property made by the Will to the former spouse and that property will be distributed as if the spouse predeceased the person making the Will. Unless the Will expressly states otherwise, any provision naming the former spouse as Executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian is also revoked. If the person making the Will and the former spouse remarry, then, absent a preponderance of evidence of an intention to the contrary, the Will shall no longer be considered revoked by this section. (2) Separation. A decree of separation, which does not terminate the status of husband and wife, is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No other change of marital circumstances revokes a Will. Section 4.4. Initiating Process for Probate or Court Validation of a Will (a) Petition for Probate . The custodian of the Will or any other person in possession of the Will, including a person named as Executor, may petition the Tribal Court for the Will to be probated under tribal law. In a probate proceeding, Tribal Court shall determine the heirs and beneficiaries; determine the validity of a Will; and determine whether there are valid claims against the estate. Probate shall result in the issuance of an order distributing the estate's assets and resolving claims against the estate. (b) Petition Requirements . The petition shall meet the following requirements: (1) Contents. The petition will be in writing, be signed by the petitioner, and include a death certificate or some other proof of death as set forth in Section 2.2 and the original Will. (2) Proof of Court Authority. The petition shall provide evidence to support a finding that the deceased was (A) either a Tribal Member or a person eligible for enrollment as a Tribal Member and resided or owned real or personal property located within the Reservation or (B) a non-member spouse of a Tribal Member who owned personal property located within the Reservation. If the deceased is a non-member spouse, the evidence must show that the spouse resided on the Reservation or otherwise consented to the Tribal Court's jurisdiction. (3) Identification of Heirs. The petition must state the names of the heirs of the deceased, if known, and include a Family Tree as certified by the Tribal Clerk. (4) Identification of Beneficiaries. The petition must state the name or names of any person specified in the Will as Executor or beneficiary and the address of such persons, if known. (5) Consent Forms. The petition may include written consent from each beneficiary to the appointment of the named Executor, if any, and the validity of the Will. If a beneficiary fails to consent to the appointment of the named Executor and the validity of the Will then notice of the filing of the petition along with a copy of the Will must be served upon that beneficiary. (c) Evidence to Show the Validity of the Will. (1) Self-Proving. If a Will is self-proving as provided for in Section 4.1(e) , the person filing the petition need not file any separate evidence from the witnesses to the Will. (2) Witness Statements. If the Will is not self-proving, the person filing the petition must include a notarized statement of at least one of the witnesses to the signing of the Will. In the statement, the witness must identify the Will as the document the deceased signed and declared to be his or her last Will. The witness and petitioner will also include a statement as to the deceased's capacity to sign a valid Will and if relevant, the circumstances surrounding the making of the Will. (3) Other Proof. Every reasonable effort shall be made to obtain the testimony of the witnesses to the Will. If their testimony is not reasonably available, the petitioner must say so in the petition. The Tribal Court may allow proof of the Will by testimony or other evidence that the signature of the person making the Will is genuine. Section 4.5. Proving or Contesting a Will (a) Notice . Within ten days of receiving a petition for probate of a Will, the Tribal Court shall issue notices that the petition has been filed. The notice shall state that anyone wishing to contest the Will shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the notice to file objections. The Tribal Court shall provide a notice to identified heirs and beneficiaries in writing by certified mail or some other form of service that provides for proof of delivery. In addition, the Petitioner shall provide notice to the public by publishing the notice for three consecutive weeks in a publication of general distribution on the Reservation. (b) Uncontested Will . If, after thirty (30) days, no objections have been filed, the Court may consider the Will to be uncontested, and may proceed based on the petition and supporting documents or evidence. (c) Contested Will . In order to contest a Will, an interested party must file an objection in writing setting forth the basis of the objections. Anyone objecting to a Will shall have the burden of proof. The Petitioner or any other interested party shall have twenty (20) days to file a reply to the objections. The Tribal Court shall take no further action with respect to the probate of the estate until a hearing has been held on any objections, such hearing to be held within thirty (30) days of the last pleadings filed. (d) Order . Upon considering all relevant evidence concerning the Will, the Tribal Court shall enter an order which either affirms that the Will may be probated by the Court or rejects such Will and orders that the probate of the deceased's estate shall proceed as if the deceased had died without making a Will. An order affirming or rejecting a Will is a final order and may be appealed to Tribal Appellate Court before probate proceeds. Section 4.6. Executor of the Will (a) When Executor is Named in Will . If the Tribal Court concludes the Will is valid, the Executor named in the Will shall be appointed to administer the estate according to the terms of this Probate Law and the deceased's Will. (b) When No Executor is Named . If there is no Executor named, an Executor shall be appointed based upon the same procedure used to appoint Administrator in Section 3.4 above. (c) Unwilling or Unable to Serve . If the appointed Executor is unwilling or unable to serve as Executor, then the Tribal Court shall appoint whomever all of the beneficiaries select and agree upon to act as Executor. Absent agreement, Tribal Court shall have discretion in making the appointment to give preference to the surviving spouse and then to a child of the deceased over eighteen (18) years of age. In the rare circumstance where there is no duly enrolled Tribal Member who is able to assume the responsibility of Executor, the Tribal Court may in its discretion name a qualified third party to serve as Executor. (d) Oath . Upon his/her appointment, the person appointed Executor shall take an oath prepared by the Tribal Court to the effect that he/she will faithfully and honestly administer the estate. The oath may be taken in person at the Tribal Court or may be done in writing on a form prepared by the Tribal Court Section 4.7. Order of Appointment as Executor (a) Order . Once the Executor takes the oath, the Tribal Court shall issue an Order of Appointment as Executor as proof of his/her appointment. Within seven (7) days, the Executor shall provide a copy of the order to the Tribal Clerk to be recorded either by delivering it in person or by certified mail. (b) Record of Order . The Tribal Clerk shall record the Order of Appointment as Executor in the Tribal Recording Book, including a copy of the Order in the records.

The Executor is not required to pay any expenses out of pocket. (b) Inventory . (1) List of Assets. The Executor is required to take an inventory of all property and assets of the deceased. Assets may or may not include family heirlooms or items of sentimental value. This inventory is to be filed with Tribal Court within thirty (30) days after his/her appointment. The inventory should include an estimated value of all property and assets of the deceased. If an asset is of significant value, such as real property, an appraisal is recommended. The inventory should also indicate those items intended to be sold for the payment of debts or other estate requirements, if any. The Executor shall provide a copy of this inventory to all persons with a known interest in the estate at the same time it is filed with the Court. (2) Objection to Inventory. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the inventory, any person with an interest in the estate may file an objection to the inventory or to the sale of any item in the inventory. (3) Hearing and Court Review. If objections to the inventory are filed, the Tribal Court shall schedule a hearing to be held within thirty (30) days of date objections are filed. The Tribal Court shall notify all interested parties of the hearing. Upon consideration of the objections, the Tribal Court may order an amendment to the inventory or appraisal, or issue an order regarding the sale of property, as it deems just and proper to carry out the terms of the estate. (c) Creditors . (1) Identification. The Executor is required to identify all creditors of the estate. To do so, the Executor shall search the deceased's records for bills, notices, loan papers, and other documentation that suggests the deceased may have outstanding debts. The Executor has the duty to contact all known creditors to determine amounts owed and the process for addressing bills and other debts. The Executor shall also publish a public notice within thirty (30) days of appointment stating that all other creditors must present their claims to the Executor and that only the claims presented may be considered for payment by the estate. The notice shall give the creditors thirty (30) days to respond and will clearly state the final date for claims to be presented. Unless there is a waiver or modification approved by the Court, the notice shall be posted on the Tribe's website, and published for three consecutive weeks in a publication of general distribution on the Reservation and if deemed necessary in the nearby towns of Massena and Malone. (2) Documentation. For those debts identified by the Executor from the estate records, the Executor shall prepare a list of the amounts owed and any necessary forms or documentation needed to resolve the debts and close accounts. Any other claims submitted by a creditor shall state under oath that his claim is justly due, that to the extent payments were made by the deceased they have been credited, and that he/she knows of no offsets against the claim. If a creditor fails to present a claim within the time period allowed, the creditor may request that the Tribal Court in its discretion allow him/her to file the claim directly with the Tribal Court at the same as the Executor presents the creditors' claims under subsection (4) below. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied. (3) Executor Review. Once the Executor collects the creditors' claims, the Executor will review them and will notify the creditors as to whether they are accepted or rejected and explain the reasons for the decision.

(B) If there are claims, the Executor shall provide the Tribal Court with a list of claims with supporting documentation explaining whether the claim has been accepted or rejected. The Executor must present this information to the Court no later than forty-five (45) days after the creditor claim period has closed. (C) Rejected creditors have ten (10) days to respond to the list filed with the Court. If after ten (10) days, no objections are filed, the Court may approve the list and the Executor may pay the approved claims. If a rejected creditor files an objection, the Tribal Court shall determine the validity of the claim and the objection, relying on the affidavit or personal testimony of the claimant. An order regarding a creditor's claim may be appealed. If an objection or appeal is filed, the Administrator may pay creditors only after the Tribal Court issues an order regarding the validity of the claims. At no time, shall the Tribal Court permit the sale of Tribal Land to satisfy an estate's debts except if the claimant can show that the deceased expected his/her land to be sold to satisfy the outstanding debt. (5) Timing In sum, the time frame for the Executor as set forth in this law is as follows: (A) Inventory. Within thirty (30) days after appointment, the Executor will present an estate inventory to the Court. Objections to the inventory are to be filed with the court no later than thirty (30) days thereafter. If objections are filed, the court must hold a hearing within thirty (30) days. (B) Creditor's Claims. Within thirty (30) days after appointment, the Executor must publish a public notice asking for creditors to bring forth their claims. A Creditor will have thirty (30) days from the date of the last public notice to file a claim with the Administrator. The Executor will have thirty (30) days from the filing of the claim to decide whether to recognize the creditor's claim. If claims are filed or debts are identified, the Executor must file a list of claims with the Court within forty-five (45) days after the claim period closes. Rejected creditors have ten (10) days to file with the Court documentation explaining why they should be paid. (d) Insufficient Estate and Reduction of Shares. (1) Priority. If there are not enough assets in the deceased's estate to make a full distribution of property under the Will, beneficiary shares shall be reduced, without any preference or priority as between real and personal property, as follows: (1) shares that may be inherited through the application of the rules for distribution without a Will are reduced first; (2) shares that may be inherited though the residual provision of a Will are reduced second, and (3) only then are specific devises under the Will reduced. (2) Proportion. The reduction of the shares is in proportion to the amount of property each of the beneficiaries would have received if a full distribution of the property had been made in accordance with the terms of the Will. (3) Specific Devise. If the estate is so insufficient that the subject of a specific devise is sold or used as part of estate administration, the remaining shares shall be adjusted to reflect the contribution of the specific devise. (e) Distribution of Estate. The Executor is responsible for distributing the estate once beneficiaries are identified and the creditors, if any, have been identified. (1) Creditors. All verified claims of creditors allowed by the Tribal Court shall be paid before distribution of the estate to the heirs. (2) Accounting. Before distributing the estate to the beneficiaries, the Executor must provide the Tribal Court with an accounting of the estate for approval.

The accounting will also show the computation of any attorney's and/or Executor's fees for which approval is sought. The accounting will set out the remaining estate to be distributed and contain a statement that the estate is ready to be distributed to the beneficiaries. The accounting may include a signed consent form from each beneficiary to the proposed distribution from the estate. (3) Advances. When distributing property among the beneficiaries, any property that was advanced is valued at the time the beneficiary came into possession of the property. (4) Executor Fee. If an Executor requests a fee, the Tribal Court shall establish the percentage for compensation on a case by case basis, but in no event shall the percentage be more than five (5%) percent of the total value of the gross estate (f) Order Approving Distribution and Closing of Estate. (1) Order of Distribution. When the Tribal Court is satisfied that an estate is ready to be distributed and the Executor has set out the plan for distribution in the accounting, the Tribal Court shall issue an order approving the distribution. (2) Closing of Estate. Once the estate is distributed, the Executor shall file a statement with the Tribal Court stating that the estate is fully administered and ready to be closed and submit receipts showing that the estate is fully distributed. Upon receipt of this statement, the estate shall be closed, the Executor of the estate shall be dismissed, and if applicable, any bond shall be released. (g) Reopening an Estate . If property is discovered after an estate has been closed, the estate may be reopened to dispose of the property. The Tribal Court shall order distribution of the property to the person or persons entitled thereto after issuing whatever orders are necessary to assure a just participation of the after-discovered property in the expenses of the estate. CHAPTER 5 STATUS OF NON-MEMBER OR NON-INDIAN Section 5.1. Tribal Council Action (a) Real Property . Non-members of the Tribe and non-Indians may not receive or hold a permanent right to possess an interest in Tribal Lands through a Will, trust instrument, or any other conveyance. (b) Tribal Council Authority . If a Tribal Member dies, and the estate is admitted to probate, the Tribal Court shall not have jurisdiction over the question of whether a surviving non-Tribal Member spouse or child may be the beneficiary of a possessory interest held by the deceased. The Tribal Council retains the authority to grant a life estate to a surviving non-Tribal Member spouse or child at the request of a Tribal Member or the non-Tribal Member spouse or child in lieu of any inheritance of such tribal property from the deceased. (c) Petition . In order to obtain the benefits of a life estate, a non-tribal member spouse, a non-member spouse on behalf of minor children, or a non-member child may petition for a life estate by completing a form designated by the Tribal Clerk's Office requesting that the Tribal Council approve a life estate. This form also shall be provided to the Tribal Court as part of the estate record. A copy of the death certificate shall accompany the request for a life estate. The petition should also include any statements of support from the family or community. (d) Rights . The Tribal Council has no obligation to grant a life estate to a non-Tribal member. Subject to the terms of the Indian Civil Rights Act, the Tribal Council's decision shall be final for the Tribe and not subject to review by the Tribal Court. A life estate can be revoked at any time since the Tribe retains the right to exclude anyone from the Reservation. (e) Interest Granted . By granting a life estate, the life estate beneficiary is entitled to the use and income from the deceased's interest in tribal property. Upon the death of the life estate beneficiary, the property shall transfer to the holder of the remainder of the estate interest or if, no other beneficiary exists, it shall revert to the Tribe.

THE SAINT REGIS MOHAWK TRIBAL COUNCIL _____________________ _____________________ _____________________ Eric Thompson Beverly Cook Michael Conners Tribal Chief Tribal Chief Tribal Chief CERTIFICATION : This is to certify that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council pursuant to the authority vested therein duly passed the above resolution. ___________________________________ March 1, 2021 Summer Bero, Tribal Clerk Date Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Hemp Production Regulations I. TITLE These regulations shall be known and cited as the \"Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Hemp Production Regulations\". II. PURPOSE, AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION A. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council (\"Tribal Council\") adopts these Hemp Production Regulations (\"Regulations\") to establish rules to govern the production of hemp on Mohawk Tribal Territory. B. Authority to adopt these Regulations derives from the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe's (\"Tribe\") inherent sovereignty to regulate activities within Mohawk Tribal Territory that includes the authority to regulate hemp production and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-334, December 20, 2018, 132 Stat. 4490 (\"Farm Bill\") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (\"USDA\") Final Rule (January 19, 2021), 86 FR 5596, recognizing a tribe's right to assume primary authority over hemp production. C. The Tribe's jurisdiction, as recognized in the USDA Final Rule, upon approval by USDA, extends to production of hemp with the Tribe's territory regardless of the extent of the Tribe's inherent regulatory authority. III. DEFINITIONS A. The following terms and phrases used in these Regulations are arranged in alphabetical order. More detailed definitions of some technical terms are contained in the USDA Final Rule, Subchapter A which is adopted and incorporated by reference in these Regulations . 1. \"Acceptable hemp THC level\" is when the application of the measurement of uncertainty to the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis produces a distribution or range that includes 0.3% or less. For example, if the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis is 0.35% and the measurement of uncertainty is +/- 0.06%, the measured delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis for this sample ranges from 0.29% to 0.41%. Because 0.3% is within the distribution or range, the sample is within the acceptable hemp THC level for plan compliance. This definition of \"acceptable hemp THC level\" affects neither the statutory definition of hemp, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639o (1), in the 2018 Farm Bill nor the definition of \"marihuana,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(16), in the CSA. 2. \"Agricultural Marketing Service\" or \"AMS\" means the Agricultural Marketing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 3. \"Cannabis\" means a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae of which Cannabissativais a species, and Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis are subspecies thereof. Cannabis refers to any form of the plant in which the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration on a dry weight basis has not yet been determined. 4. \"Conviction\" means any plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or any finding of guilt, except when the finding of guilt is subsequently overturned on appeal, pardoned, or expunged. For purposes of these Regulations , a conviction is expunged when the conviction is removed from the individual's criminal history record and there are no legal disabilities or restrictions associated with the expunged conviction, other than the fact that the conviction may be used for sentencing purposes for subsequent convictions. In addition, where an individual is allowed to withdraw an original plea of guilty or nolo contendere and enter a plea of not guilty and the case is subsequently dismissed, the individual is no longer considered to have a conviction. 5. \"Corrective action plan\" means a plan established by the Tribe for a licensed hemp producer to correct a negligent violation or non-compliance. 6. \"Criminal History Report\" means the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Identity History Summary. 7. \"Culpable mental state greater than negligence\" means to act intentionally, knowingly, willfully, or recklessly. 8. \"Decarboxylated\" means the completion of the chemical reaction that converts THC-acid (THC-A) into delta-9-THC, the intoxicating component of cannabis. The decarboxylated value is also calculated using a conversion formula that sums delta-9-THC and eighty-seven and seven tenths (87.7) percent of THC-acid. 9. \"Decarboxylation\" means the removal or elimination of carboxyl group from a molecule or organic compound. 10. \"Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol\" or \"THC\" is the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. For the purposes of this part, delta-9 THC and THC are interchangeable. 11. \"Disposal\" means an activity that transitions a non-compliant product into a non-retrievable or non-ingestible form. Such activities include plowing, tilling, or disking plant material into the soil; mulching, composting, chopping, or bush mowing plant material into green manure; burning plant material; burying plant material into the earth and covering with soil. 12. \"Drug Enforcement Administration\" or \"DEA\" means the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. 13. \"Dry weight basis\" means the ratio of the amount of moisture in a sample to the amount of dry solid in a sample. A basis for expressing the percentage of a chemical in a substance after removing the moisture from the substance. Percentage of THC on a dry weight basis means the percentage of THC, by weight, in a cannabis item (plant, extract, or other derivative), after excluding moisture from the item. 14. \"Entity\" means a corporation, joint stock company, association, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, irrevocable trust, estate, charitable organization, or other similar organization, including any such organization participating in the hemp production as a partner in a general partnership, a participant in a joint venture, or a participant in a similar organization. 15. \"Farm Service Agency\" or \"FSA\" is an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. 16. \"Gas chromatography\" or \"GC\" means a type of chromatography in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. GC relies on heat for separating and analyzing compounds that can be vaporized without decomposition. 17. \"Geospatial location\" means a location designated through a global system of navigational satellites used to determine the precise ground position of a place or object. 18. \"Hemp\" means the plant species Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. 19. \"High-performance liquid chromatography\" or \"HPLC\" is a type of chromatography technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. HPLC relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material to separate and analyze compounds. 20. \"Key participants\" means a sole proprietor, a partner in partnership, or a person with executive managerial control in a corporation. A person with executive managerial control includes persons such as a chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. This definition does not include non-executive managers such as farm, field, or shift managers. 21. \"Law enforcement agency\" refers to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Police Department or, in some circumstances, a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency. 22. \"Lot\" means a contiguous area in a field, greenhouse, or indoor growing structure containing the same variety or strain of cannabis throughout the area. The term lot also means the terms \"farm,\" \"tract,\" \"field,\" and \"subfield\" as these are terms are used by FSA in 7 CFR 718.2 to define lot. 23. \"Marijuana\" or \"marihuana\" means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. The term 'marihuana' does not include hemp, as defined in section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 and does not include the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination (7 U.S.C. 1639o). \"Marihuana\" means all cannabis that tests as having a concentration level of THC on a dry weight basis of higher than 0.3 percent. 24. \"Measurement of Uncertainty (MU)\" is the parameter, associated with the result of a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the quantity subject to measurement. 25. \"Negligence\" means the failure to exercise the level of care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in complying with these Regulations . 26. \"Post decarboxylation\" means a value determined after the process of decarboxylation that determines the total potential delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content derived from the sum of the THC and THC-A content and reported on a dry weight basis. The post decarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The post decarboxylation value of THC can also be calculated by using a high-performance liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THC-A intact, and requires a conversion calculation of that THC-A to calculate total potential THC in a given sample. 27. \"Produce\" means to grow hemp plants for market, or for cultivation for market, in the United States. For purposes of these Regulations it also includes, but is not limited to, cultivation, extraction, obtaining seeds, handling hemp, storage, transportation and shipment of hemp to market. 28. \"Remediation\" refers to the process of rendering non-compliant cannabis, compliant. Remediation can occur by removing and destroying flower material, while retaining stalk, stems, leaf material, and seeds. Remediation can also occur by shredding the entire plant into a biomass like material, then re-testing the shredded biomass material for compliance. 29. \"Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe\" or \"Tribe\" means the federally recognized Indian Tribe, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe with government offices in Akwesasne, New York. 30. \"Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Police\" means the law enforcement department for the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe with police authority over Tribal Territory. 31. \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 32. \"Total THC\" is the value determined after the process of decarboxylation, or the application of a conversion factor if the testing methodology does not include decarboxylation, that expresses the potential total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content derived from the sum of the THC and THCA content and reported on a dry weight basis. This post-decarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, such as gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The total THC can also be calculated by using a liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THCA intact. This technique requires the use of the following conversion: [Total THC = (0.877 x THCA) + THC] which calculates the potential total THC in a given sample. 33. \"Tribal Member\" or \"Mohawk Tribal Member\" means a person who is enrolled in the Tribe under the Tribe's Membership Code or a person who is eligible to be enrolled regardless of where they reside. 34. \"Tribal Member-Owned Business\" or \"Tribal Member Business\" means an entity that is more than fifty percent (50%) owned and controlled by a Tribal Member. \"Controlled\" means to have controlling interest whereby a person holds a majority of a company's voting stock, giving them significant influence over any corporate actions. A person or group of persons having a controlling interest will be able to direct the course of a company and make strategic and operational decisions. 35. \"Tribal Territory\" or \"Mohawk Tribal Territory\" means all lands within the 1796 Treaty with the Seven Nations of Canada (97 Stat. 55) and includes any other lands over which the Tribe exercises jurisdiction. It also includes rights-of-way running through the 1796 Reservation; and any land title to which is either held in trust by the United States for the benefit the Tribe or individual or held by the Tribe or individual subject to restriction by the United States against alienation and over which the Tribe exercises jurisdiction.

Within 30 days prior to the anticipated harvest of cannabis plants, a producer shall have the HCO's sampling agent collect samples from the producer's crop for total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration level testing. The sampling agent will be a person who is trained by the HCO to conduct sampling under USDA rules. Producers may not collect samples from their own growing facilities. 2. Samples shall be obtained from the flowering tops of plants when flowering tops are present, and shall be approximately five to eight inches in length from the \"main stem\" (that includes the leaves and flowers), \"terminal bud\" (that occurs at the end of a stem), or \"central cola\" (cut stem that could develop into a bud) of the flowering top of the plant. B. Sampling Methods. 1. The method used for sampling must be sufficient at a confidence level of 95 percent that no more than one percent of the plants in each lot would exceed the acceptable hemp THC level and ensure that a representative sample is collected that represents a homogeneous composition of the lot. 2. Alternatively, the Tribe may adopt a performance-based method subject to USDA approval. 3. The alternative method must have the potential to ensure, at a confidence level of 95 percent, that the cannabis plant species Cannabis sativa L. that will be subject to the alternative method will not test above the acceptable hemp THC level. The alternative method may consider one or more of the following factors: (a) Seed certification process or process that identifies varieties that have consistently demonstrated to result in compliant hemp plants within Tribal Territory; (b) Whether the producer is conducting research on hemp; (c) Whether a producer has consistently produced compliant hemp plants over an extended period of time; and (d) Factors similar to those identified above in 3(a)-(c). C. Sample Collection Protocol. 1. During a scheduled sample collection, the producer or an authorized representative of the producer shall be present at the growing site if possible. 2. Sampling agents shall be provided with complete and unrestricted access during business hours to all hemp and other cannabis plants (whether growing or harvested), to areas where hemp is grown and stored, and to all land, buildings, and other structures used for the cultivation, handling, and storage of all hemp and other cannabis plants, and all locations listed in the producer license. 3. A producer shall not harvest the cannabis crop prior to samples being taken. D. Inspections. 1. The HCO shall conduct annual inspections of a random sample of no less than 10% of all producers to verify that hemp is not produced in violation of these Regulations . VII. TESTING A. General Requirements. 1. Laboratory testing of samples will be conducted so that the HCO is able to accurately identify whether the sample contains a total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level that exceeds the acceptable hemp THC level are as follows. 2. The testing procedure will include a validated testing methodology that uses post- decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods. The testing methodology must consider the potential conversion of THCA in hemp into THC and the test result must report the total available THC derived from the sum of the THC and THCA content. Testi.g methodologies meeting the requirements of this Section include, but are not limited to, gas or liquid chromatography with detection. The total THC concentration level shall be determined and reported on a dry weight basis. 3. Any test of a representative sample resulting in higher than the acceptable hemp THC level shall be conclusive evidence that the lot represented by the sample is not in compliance with this part and shall be disposed of or remediated in accordance with Section VIII . 4. Samples of hemp plant material from one lot shall not be commingled with hemp plant material from other lots. B. Testing Laboratories. 1. Laboratories conducting analytical testing for purposes of detecting the concentration levels of Total THC shall meet the following requirements: (a) Laboratory quality assurance must ensure the validity and reliability of test results; (b) Analytical method selection, validation, and verification must ensure that the testing method used is appropriate (fit for purpose), and that the laboratory can successfully perform the testing; (c) The demonstration of testing validity must ensure consistent, accurate analytical performance; (d) Method performance specifications must ensure analytical tests are sufficiently sensitive for the purposes of the detectability requirements of this part; and (e) Effective disposal procedures for non-compliant samples that do not meet the requirements of this part. (f) Measurement of uncertainty (MU) must be estimated and reported with test results. Laboratories shall use appropriate, validated methods and procedures for all testing activities and evaluate measurement of uncertainty. (g) Sample preparation of pre- or post-harvest samples shall require grinding of samples to ensure homogeneity of plant material prior to testing. Sample preparation may follow a procedure described by USDA. (h) After December 31, 2022, the Tribe shall require that only laboratories registered with the DEA may conduct testing under these Regulations . 2. The Tribe will require testing laboratories to comply with USDA reporting requirements. 3. Laboratories shall only report formal test results that are used to determine compliance under these Regulations . Test results from informal testing conducted throughout the growing season shall not be reported to USDA. VIII. DISPOSAL AND REMEDIATION A. General Procedure. 1. Cannabis plants exceeding the acceptable hemp THC level constitute marijuana, a schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and producers must either use a DEA-registered reverse distributor or law enforcement to dispose of non-compliant plants or ensure the disposal of such cannabis plant on site at the farm or hemp production facility. 2. Producers must notify the HCO of their intent to dispose of or remediate non-conforming plants and verify disposal or remediation by submitting required documentation. 3. If a producer elects to perform remediation activities, an additional sampling and testing of the post-remediated crop must occur to determine THC concentration levels. B. Disposal Or Remediation Procedures. 1. Disposal and remediation when a producer's plants are deemed non-compliant shall be conducted as follows: (a) Disposal must be conducted either by using a DEA-registered reverse distributor or law enforcement; or on site at the farm or hemp production facility. (b) The Tribe will provide procedures to verify the disposal or remediation of the cannabis plant. This may be done in the form of in-person verification by the HCO or alternative requirements that direct growers to provide pictures, videos, or other proof that disposal or remediation occurred successfully. (Disposal and remediation means are described at AMS's website). (c) If a producer elects to perform remediation activities, an additional sampling and testing of the post-remediated crop must occur to determine THC concentration levels. IX. VIOLATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT A. Responsibility Of Producer After Laboratory Testing Is Performed. 1. The producer shall harvest the crop no later than thirty (30) days after the date of sample collection. 2. If the producer fails to complete harvest within thirty (30) days of sample collection, a second pre-harvest sample of the lot shall be required to be submitted for testing. 3. Harvested lots of hemp plants shall not be commingled with other harvested lots or other material. 4. Lots that meet the acceptable hemp THC level may enter the stream of commerce. 5. Lots that do not meet the acceptable hemp THC level are subject to Sections B - E , below. 6. Any producer may request additional pre-harvest testing if it is believed that the original total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration level test results were in error. Additional testing may be conducted by the laboratory that conducted the initial test, or another laboratory. B. Non-Compliant Cannabis Plants. 1. Cannabis plants exceeding the acceptable hemp THC level constitute marijuana, a schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and producers must either use a DEA-registered reverse distributor or law enforcement to dispose of non-compliant plants or ensure the disposal of such cannabis plant on site at the farm or hemp production facility. 2. Producers must notify the HCO of their intent to dispose of or remediate non-conforming plants and verify disposal or remediation by submitting required documentation. 3. If a producer elects to perform remediation activities, an additional sampling and testing of the post-remediated crop must occur to determine THC concentration levels. C. Violations. 1. Violations of this part shall be subject to enforcement in accordance with the terms of this section . (a) Negligent violations. Hemp producers are not subject to more than one negligent violation per calendar year. A hemp producer shall be subject to enforcement for negligently: (1) Failing to provide an accurate legal description of land where hemp is produced; (2) Producing hemp without a license; and (3) Producing cannabis exceeding the acceptable hemp THC level. Hemp producers do not commit a negligent violation under this paragraph (a) if they make reasonable efforts to grow hemp and the cannabis does not have a total THC concentration of more than 1.0 percent on a dry weight basis. (b) Corrective action for negligent violations. For each negligent violation, the HCO will issue a Notice of Violation and require a corrective action plan from the producer. The producer shall comply with the corrective action plan to cure the negligent violation. Corrective action plans will be in place for a minimum of two (2) years from the date of their approval. Corrective action plans will, at a minimum, include: (1) The date by which the producer shall correct each negligent violation; (2) Steps that will be taken to correct each negligent violation; and (3) A description of the procedures that will demonstrate compliance must be submitted to the HCO. (c) Negligent violations and criminal enforcement. A producer who negligently violates this part shall not, as a result of that violation, be subject to any criminal enforcement action by any Federal, State, Tribal, or local government. (d) Subsequent negligent violations. If a subsequent negligent violation occurs while a corrective action plan is in place, a new corrective action plan must be submitted with a heightened level of quality control, staff training, and quantifiable action measures. (e) Negligent violations and license revocation.

SAINT REGIS MOHAWK TRIBAL COUNCIL _____________________ _____________________ _____________________ Michael Conners Eric Thompson Beverly Cook Tribal Chief Tribal Chief Tribal Chief CERTIFICATION : This is to certify that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council pursuant to the authority vested therein duly passed the above resolution. ___________________________________ February 26, 2020 Summer Bero, Tribal Clerk Date Solid Waste Management Code Section 1. 1.1 INTRODUCTION It is the tradition of the Mohawk People to look generations forward in planning. It is with this foresight that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Solid Waste Management Code (\"Code\") is intended. Solid waste disposal practices need to be maintained in good harmony with Mother Earth since these practices will have an effect on the future generations inheriting this land. Adherence to this Code will ensure that best practices for solid waste management are maintained. 1.2 AUTHORITY The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (\"Tribe\" or \"SRMT\") has the inherent authority to manage and regulate the storage, collection, transportation, handling, treatment and disposal of solid waste in a manner which best protects Mother Earth, her natural resources, and the health, welfare, and economic security of this generation of Mohawk People and the generations to follow. The Tribe retains the inherent sovereign power to exercise civil authority and jurisdiction over the conduct of both Tribal and non-Tribal members on all lands within the Saint Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation (\"Reservation\"). These civil actions will be taken when necessary to maintain the environment, natural resources, public health, safety, welfare, political integrity and economic security of the Tribe. 1.3 PURPOSE This Code does not allow for the improper disposal of any Solid Waste on the Reservation. Improper disposal or creating an Open Dump of any Solid Waste materials or recyclables, whether on the side of the road, in the Community Recycling Depot, or anywhere that they should not be disposed of, will be considered a violation of the Code. Disposal of such Solid Waste or creating an Open Dump site is different than someone who litters as outlined in the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Traffic Code Section III(5)(f) ( TCR 2018-09 or as amended). It is the intent of this Code to create a comprehensive integrated waste management policy that requires all solid waste to be disposed of properly at management facilities on and off the Reservation. This Code encourages Mohawk People to reduce, recycle and reuse those materials that do not belong in the waste stream. Education of the community through diverse media has been a continuing process, aimed at eliminating the poor solid waste disposal practices of the past. The Code intends to: (1) Protect the health and safety of Tribal members and all other persons within the Reservation; (2) Protect the cultural, social and economic stability of residential, agricultural, commercial, industrial, forest, riparian, and environmentally sensitive lands within the Reservation; (3) Protect the historical and cultural values and traditions of the Tribe, Mohawk land as a permanent Tribal homeland, and maintain its aboriginal character; (4) Prevent solid waste pollution, including contamination of the Tribe's groundwater, surface waters, drinking water supplies, and all other natural resources; (5) Prevent the deterioration of the environment, standard of living, quality of life, welfare and well-being of all persons within the Reservation; and (6) Provide and promote Tribal waste management efficiency and services within the Reservation.

To accomplish this mission as it relates to solid waste management, the Tribe hereby appoints the Environment Division as the lead Tribal agency to ensure the proper management of solid wastes while the Tribe's Compliance Department is delegated the authority to issue permits and maintain compliance with this Code . The Environment Division and the Compliance Department shall each have the powers, duties, and responsibilities as provided herein. The Environment Division shall develop and manage the Tribe's comprehensive integrated waste management policy and regulations using both the traditional concept of seven generations and by the duties specifically designated in this Code or as may be assigned from time to time by the Environment Division Director or Tribal Council. The Environment Division shall communicate to the community information regarding the Tribe's comprehensive integrated waste management policy and make reports containing such information as the Tribe approves, excluding any confidential or privileged information. 3.1.1 Duties of the Environment Division with Respect to Solid Wastes. The Environment Division is entrusted to protect the land, air, water, vegetation and animal life for the future generations from the detrimental effects of improper management of solid waste. To accomplish this task the Environment Division shall perform the following: (1) Develop and implement the Tribe's Solid Waste Management Plan. The goal of the Solid Waste Management Plan is to provide guidance to manage solid wastes in a manner that honors the earth, people, plants, animals, and waters, while contributing to the economic and social progress of the community. (2) Build on the community's inherent respect for the natural world by maintaining and improving the processes and equipment utilized in the management of solid wastes, recyclable and reusable materials. Provide the technical standards and criteria for the collection and transportation of Solid Waste. (3) Prepare an inventory and location of all open dumping sites in and around the Reservation where solid wastes have been disposed, and a plan to close all such sites. (4) Encourage community involvement and input in the Tribe's Solid Waste Management Plan; (5) Prepare technical reports as may be requested from time to time, including environmental assessments as may be necessary. (6) Administer, supervise, monitor, and investigate the collection, transportation, and disposal of Solid Waste on the Reservation in compliance with this Code , as well as adhere to all laws, rules and regulations, and Guidance Documents promulgated hereunder.

The Compliance Department shall prepare a report which will then be submitted to the Environment Division, Tribal Council and General Counsel. A credible complaint is a complaint that relates to, but is not limited to, improper disposal methods, unauthorized acceptance of special wastes, inappropriate handling, collection and transportation of solid waste and/or worker safety issues. If a complaint is founded then an Enforcement Action pursuant to Section 6.3 may be undertaken. For any complaint that is unfounded a report shall be transmitted to the complainant within thirty (30) days of the investigation's completion. Section 4. Proper Handling, Collection and Disposal of Solid Wastes 4.1 INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT An integrated waste management approach shall be used for the management of Solid Wastes. This approach shall promote reducing, reusing, and recycling, followed by disposal. The Environment Division may issue rules and regulations for reducing, reusing, and recycling of solid wastes on the Reservation. Proper and safe practices based on industry standards will be developed to increase safety in the recovery phase of these efforts. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe will abide by restrictions on recyclables at the landfill (County of Franklin Solid Waste \"Local Law No. 3\".) The following rules apply to this Solid Waste Code for recyclable materials: a. All recyclables shall be separated from Municipal Solid Waste b. Designated Recyclables shall not be contaminated with hazardous waste or any other solid waste. c. Recyclables will be delivered in a manner to follow these requirements or they may be rejected. 4.2 OPEN DUMPING The open dumping of Solid Wastes on the Reservation is disrespectful and does irreparable damage to the land and the environment. Much of this waste can last longer than seven generations and can affect even more generations through contamination of: soil, groundwater, and surface waters. Proper disposal of these materials can be accomplished through the utilization of Management Facilities, Haulers and/or taken directly off reservation to permitted disposal areas. It is a violation of this Code for anyone or business to operate an Open Dump site. If there is an allegation of an Open Dump site it shall be investigated. The Open Dump site shall immediately cease to operate and violator will be subject to enforcement actions as outlined in Section 6.3 . if the matter was not resolved under Section 3.1.2 . It is a violation of this Code to dump, scatter or place any solid wastes anywhere except at a duly authorized and designated solid waste transfer station or landfill. Any written or verbal allegation of open dumping shall be forwarded to the Compliance Department to investigate. If the alleged violator's conduct does not cease after the Compliance Department has undertaken efforts to seek cooperation to stop the offending behavior, it may then determine whether to refer the matter to Tribal Police or the Environment Division for further enforcement action. If there are further enforcement actions and the matter is brought to the Tribal Court, it shall be dealt with according to Section 6.4 . 4.3 BURNING OF SOLID WASTE Any burning of Solid Wastes will be done in accordance with the open burn regulations established by the Environment Division's Clean Air Program (see TCR 2002-59 or as amended) 4.4 HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTES On specified days during the calendar year, certain Household Hazardous Wastes will be accepted at specific drop off areas on the Reservation for proper disposal. Only on those days and at those locations will a limited number of prohibited special wastes be accepted. The wastes allowed will be listed and announced thirty (30) calendar days prior to the collection date by the Director of the Environment Division. All items to be included in the Household Hazardous Waste collection will be compiled on a list by the Director of the Environment Division. The permitted items will be announced in a locally circulated newspaper, the Tribe's website, social media and radio for at least three (3) consecutive weeks prior to collection activities. Disposal methods and containers will follow recognized standards established by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Rules and regulations adopted by the Environment Division may be used if those methods specified meet or exceed the minimum standards established by USEPA and OSHA. If the Director or any employee involved with the collection of Household Hazardous Waste is in doubt regarding the safe handling of a product, then such product will be returned to the individual who transported it to the collection point. Collection of Household Hazardous Waste will occur based solely on the availability of funding. If the Environment Division deems that regularly scheduled collections are necessary in its discretion, under rules and regulations to be adopted by the Environment Division, then the necessary steps and procedures will be taken to assure regularly scheduled collections.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council hereby adopt the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Pesticide Regulation, as attached hereto, effective the date of this Resolution. SAINT REGIS MOHAWK TRIBAL COUNCIL _____________________ _____________________ _____________________ Michael Conners Eric Thompson Beverly Cook Tribal Chief Tribal Chief Tribal Chief CERTIFICATION: This is to certify that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council pursuant to the authority vested therein duly passed the above resolution. ___________________________________ January 8,2020 Summer Bero, Tribal Clerk Date Tribal Pesticide Regulation Section 1.0. Purpose The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (The \"Tribe\"), is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all community members. With respect to pesticide usage it has the authority, responsibility and jurisdiction to exercise sovereign rights in governing pesticide usage on the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation (Reservation). Through its Environment Division, the Tribe has determined that the management of pesticides through Tribal regulation will ensure the protection of Tribal member health by reducing unnecessary health risk exposures to pesticides. Further, the EPA's regulations under Environmental Protection Acts, Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 171 provide that: 1. An Indian tribe may develop its own plan for certifying private and commercial applicators to use or supervise the use of Restricted Use Pesticides (RUPS), subject to the approval of EPA; 2. If a tribe does not develop its own certification plan, the tribe may choose to utilize a state's certification program, with the concurrence of that state, subject to the approval of EPA; or 3. EPA can implement a federal plan for the certification of applicators of RUPS where no other EPA-approved state or tribal applicator certification plan is in effect. The Tribe's strategy for regulating pesticide usage within its jurisdiction is to exercise option 3, relying upon EPA to certify RUP applicators. Additionally, the Tribe will exercise its sovereign right to regulate the use of General Use Pesticides (GUPS) within its jurisdiction through this regulation. Section 2.0. Authority The authority of the Tribe to enact the Pesticide Regulation lies in the inherent sovereign authority of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe the Tribal Procedures Act section IV (C) (1), (2), (10) and (13) ( TCR 2013-32 ); and the Tribal Court and Judiciary Code Section V and VI (TCR 2008- 22). Tribes cannot be granted primacy status under FIFRA. The EPA, however, does permit cooperative agreements to tribes who cooperate with EPA for the enforcement of FIFRA and who have developed their own Tribal Codes for pesticide use on tribal lands. If a tribal inspector uses tribal credentials for an inspection, enforcement can be pursued by the Tribal Council. If EPA credentials are used for an inspection, the Tribe shall send the inspection file and all information to the EPA's regional office. Section 2.1. Federal Certification Rule Under the authority of Section 11(a)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, Rodenticide, Act (FIFRA), and in accordance with the regulations found at Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 171.11, the EPA is implementing a federal pesticide applicator certification plan (EPA plan) for those areas of Indian country where no other EPA-approved or EPA-implemented plan applies. This EPA plan describes a program for the certification of applicators of restricted use pesticides (RUPS) in Indian country based on the certification requirements enumerated at 40 CFR Part 171.

Hearings on Violations Informal/Formal Hearings: The Officer shall afford the landowner or his or her representative reasonable opportunities to discuss proposed enforcement actions at an informal or formal hearing prior to taking further enforcement action, unless the Officer determines that there may be either imminent environmental damage to a Reservation resource or adverse impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the Reservation population. Informal or formal hearings may be used at any stage in the enforcement proceedings, except that the Officer may refuse to conduct informal or formal hearings with respect to any matter then pending before the Officer. Reports Required: The Officer shall keep written notes of the date and place of the hearing, the persons in attendance, the subject matter discussed and any decisions reached with respect to further enforcement action. Enforcement Hearings: If the landowner and the Officer are unable to resolve the matter via an informal or formal hearing, the Officer is authorized to conduct adjudicatory hearings to determine if a violation of this Code has occurred. In such a hearing the person so charged shall be entitled, at his or her own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other representative. The Officer shall rule that a violation of this Ordinance has occurred if it finds that the charges are supported by a preponderance of the credible evidence, which supports a finding that a violation occurred. Within thirty (30) days after the date of any enforcement hearing, the Officer shall issue a written decision. If the Officer determines that a violation has occurred and that the person(s) charged was (were) responsible for the violation, the Officer's decision shall include an Enforcement Order. Civil Penalties and Corrective Action: An Enforcement Order shall direct any person(s) found to have committed a violation of this Ordinance to take whatever corrective action the Officer deems appropriate under the circumstances. An Enforcement Order may impose civil penalties in accordance with a schedule of civil penalties prescribed under these rules. Alternatively, an Enforcement Order may impose civil penalties in the event that a person found to have committed a violation of this Code does not take corrective action in accordance with the Order within a prescribed time frame. If a person who has been found to have committed a violation does not take corrective action within the prescribed time frame, an appropriate department or agency of the Tribal government may take the necessary corrective action, in which case the amount of any civil penalty shall be increased by twice the amount of the cost incurred by the Tribal department or agency in taking the corrective action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, if the Officer determines that noncompliance with this Ordinance is presenting an imminent and substantial threat to the public health, welfare or environment and determines, in consultation with the Tribe's attorneys, that it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the public health, welfare or environment of an administrative or judicial enforcement action under this part, the Officer may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect the public health, welfare or environment. Any such order shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall remain in effect for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days. Revocation of Permit. Failure of any person to comply with any Enforcement Orders shall result in an immediate revocation of his or her permit. In order to obtain a reinstatement of such permit, the person(s) against whom the Enforcement Order was issued must first demonstrate compliance with the Order and pay all outstanding penalties and then petition for reinstatement of the permit with the name of the particular Tribal Agency]. Special Provisions for Tribal Departments and Agencies: In any case in which any Tribal agency or department is alleged to have violated the terms and conditions of a pesticide permit, or to have conducted activities without a permit, the Compliance Department shall bring the matter to the attention of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, Tribal Council who shall consider taking action to ensure compliance with this Ordinance. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the particular Tribal Agency shall conduct an enforcement hearing for the purpose of making factual determinations and issuing a decision recommending a course of corrective action if necessary. Section 8.0. Appeals Once the Compliance Officer has issued a decision any person who is aggrieved by the decision has the right to appeal through the Tribal Appellate Court. This appeal must be filed in writing as a notice of appeal to the Tribal Appellate Court. Any person who is aggrieved by the issuance or denial of an applicator permit without respect to whether that person, corporation or other entity is a party to such permit application, or who is the subject of an Enforcement Order, may file an appeal with the Tribal Appellate Court. The Tribal Appellate Court is authorized to hear such appeals. Section 9.0.

APPENDIX A LOW IMPACT PESTICIDES The following ingredients or types of pesticides are also considered low impact. a. Formulation Types - gels, pastes, or baits. Ant traps and insecticide gels are good examples of this class of low impact pesticides. Rodent baits also fit into this designation, although rodent baits should be rare. b. Antimicrobial products - pesticides used to kill microorganisms such as bacteria and fungus. Disinfectants, cleaners, mold and mildew removers all fall into this classification. \"Antimicrobial agents\" means: 1. Disinfectants intended to destroy or irreversibly inactivate infectious or other undesirable bacteria, pathogenic fungi, or viruses on surfaces or inanimate objects; 2. Sanitizers intended to reduce the number of living bacteria or viable virus particles on inanimate surfaces, in water, or in air; 3. Bacteriostats intended to inhibit the growth of bacteria in the presence of moisture; 4. Sterilizers intended to destroy viruses and all living bacteria, fungi, and their spores, on inanimate surfaces; or 5. Fungicides and fungistats intended to inhibit the growth of, or destroy fungi (including yeasts) pathogenic to man or other animals on inanimate surfaces; 6. Commodity preservatives and protectants intended to inhibit the growth of, or destroy bacteria in or on raw materials (such as adhesives or plastics) used in manufacturing, or manufactured products (such as fuel, textiles, lubricants, and paints); or 7. General use algaecides labeled for use in: i. Swimming pools, hot tubs, whirlpools, spas, ornamental ponds, fountains, fish tanks, and waterbeds; ii. Water, wastewater and sewerage treatment plants, but only where there is a controlled inlet and outlet; and iii. Industrial, commercial, and manufacturing processes. c. Specific Active Ingredients - Specific pesticide ingredients added to the low impact designation are: 1. boric acid 2. disodium octoborate tetrahydrate 3. silica gel 4. diatomaceous earth d. Microbe based insecticides - the most common example of this would be bacillus thuringiensis or \"Bt\", a widely used microbe that is the ingredient in many home and garden products, mosquito larvicides, and gypsy moth control products. e. Botanical insecticides (not synthetic) - a common example of this would be pyrethrins, extracted from the chrysanthemum plant, or neem oil that is extracted from kernels of the neem plant. Synthetic versions of botanicals or those that contain chemical synergists to enhance the potency do not qualify as low impact. f. Biological, living control agents- a common example of this would be a pesticide that uses parasitic nematodes (a small worm-like organism) as its active ingredient. These nematodes are used to control a wide variety of insects. Beneficial insects would be another type of control agent that would fit into this category.", "num": "2020-01", "path": "library|us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions|2020|Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res.

If the registered entity or Authority determines that the cost or pricing data submitted is inaccurate, incomplete or noncurrent prior to the Authority's approval of the price, the registered entity shall submit new data to correct the deficiency, or consider the inaccuracy, incompleteness, or noncurrency of the data. Section 11.4. Duration of Price Determination (a) The Authority's approved price shall be in effect for the entire period of the registered entity's registration; provided, however, that at the conclusion of the first year of the registration period, or prior to that time based upon documented exceptional circumstances, the registered entity may request that the price be modified based upon a material change in the registered entity's costs. The registered entity shall fully support its request with sufficient information and documentation, in a manner and format determined by the Authority, to justify its request. If the Authority denies such request, the registered entity shall only charge prices previously approved by the Authority. (b) If the Authority has approved a price, the registered entity shall immediately notify the Authority of any cost or pricing data submitted that it determines was inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent as of the date of the Authority's approval of the price.

The paternity of a child born outside of a marriage may be established through: (1) genetic testing, (2) as agreed between the parties, (3) as ordered by SRMT Tribal Court; (4) through an acknowledgment of paternity or (5) a birth certificate if the jurisdiction in which the child is born establishes paternity through a birth certificate. 2. A parent can revoke an acknowledgment of paternity within sixty (60) days of signing. A parent can petition the SRMT Court to revoke an acknowledgment of paternity if more than sixty (60) days has passed since signing it, but only on the grounds of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact. C. Actions for Establishment of Paternity 1. Any interested party, including the biological mother, the putative father, the child's legal guardian, the child, or the SRMT-CSEU on behalf of the Tribe by assignment of interest from the custodial parent, may petition the court for the determination of the paternity of a child. No child support can be ordered unless paternity has been established. 2. Establishment of paternity under this Act has no effect on Tribal enrollment, membership or eligibility for membership. Membership determinations are separate and distinct from the establishment of paternity. Any person wishing to file a membership application may do so with the Tribal Clerk of the SRMT. D. Establishment of Paternity 1. A petition for the establishment of paternity shall contain the following information: a. The name, date of birth and tribal affiliation (if known) of the child or children and the date ranges of conception; b. The names, dates of birth, tribal affiliation (if known) and addresses of the biological mother and the putative father(s) in the action; c. If there is a protective order in place, the address of the affected party and of any children shall be redacted from all court documents; d. If there is reason to believe that emotional or physical harm may be inflicted should the whereabouts of a party or a child be disclosed, the petitioner shall state the reason and request the Court to issue an Order redacting the personal information from all court documents that respondent can access; e. A statement regarding the father's access to the mother prior to the child's conception or birth; f. A statement indicating if there has ever been any other proceeding including any state court or other tribal court, involving the child or children in the action for paternity, custody, placement or child support; and g. A statement indicating whether the custodial party will be seeking a child support order if paternity is established; and h. A copy of any order entered by a state court or other tribal court. 2. A paternity petition shall contain the following notices: a. that if the parties agree, they have the right to voluntarily acknowledge paternity by executing an Acknowledgment of Paternity at Mediation or at the initial court appearance; b. that either party can request genetic testing if paternity is contested by either party. The party requesting genetic testing, however, shall bear the burden of paying for it unless he/she can demonstrate why he/she should not pay for it; c. that if child support is requested, it shall be determined using the child support guideline calculation; d. that if paternity is established and child support is requested, that support shall commence from the date that paternity is established. 3. An Answer which denies paternity may rely on the following a. The putative father was sterile or impotent at the time of conception; and/or b. The putative father and the biological mother did not have sexual intercourse at the time of conception; or c. That the mother was married to someone else at the time of the child's birth; or d. The putative father is not the biological father of the child. E. Initial Appearance for Paternity 1. If the putative father and the biological mother are willing to voluntarily acknowledge paternity without the use of genetic tests, the Tribal Court shall issue a final order establishing the putative father as the legal father of the minor child. 2. If paternity is contested, the SRMT Tribal Court shall order that genetic testing be performed within ten (10) days of the hearing. The Order shall contain the date, time and location of the genetic testing and shall comply with the requirements of this Act . 3. Upon proper notice in the Summons, if one or both parties fail to appear at the initial court appearance, a Default Order of paternity shall be entered unless the party who failed to appear requested that the appearance date be changed or notified the Court that he/she was unable to attend the hearing for good cause. A party may only request one change to the court date or be excused once for good cause. Thereafter, failure to appear at a rescheduled court date shall result in an automatic default judgment. F. Circumstances Where Paternity May Not Be Established 1. If the child subject to the action was conceived as a result of forcible rape or incest, and the victim or guardian has requested that paternity establishment not proceed, SRMT- CSEU will not file an action in Tribal Court for paternity establishment. If this information is received following the filing of the Summons and Petition, the Tribal Court shall dismiss the action. If SRMT-CSEU filed the action, it shall request the dismissal from the Tribal Court. 2. In any case in which a legal proceeding for adoption is pending, if, in the opinion of the SRMT-CSEU, it would not be in the best interests of the child to establish paternity, an action for paternity establishment will not be filed. If this information is received following the filing of the Summons and Petition, the Tribal Court may dismiss the action. If SRMT- CSEU filed the action, it may request the dismissal of the action by filing a motion for an Order to Dismiss. G. Genetic Testing 1. In ordering genetic testing, the SRMT-CSEU or the SRMT Tribal Court shall ensure that: a. Genetic test samples are collected by certified buccal swab collectors at the SRMT-CSEU; b. Genetic testing samples are provided to an accredited genetic testing laboratory with a notice to where to send the results; c. Results should be sent to the SRMT-CSEU if the parties attended Mediation and wish to resolve the matter without further litigation. If the matter is pending in Tribal Court the results shall be sent to it; d. Once Tribal Court has received genetic testing samples it shall notify the parties and notify the parties of the next court date. Once SRMT-CSEU has received the results, it shall notify the parties and notify them of a new Mediation date; e. If genetic tests show that the putative father is the biological father by a percentage of 99.0% or higher, paternity is presumed and the putative father shall be adjudicated the legal father; f. Whenever the results of the genetic tests exclude the putative father as the biological father of the child, this evidence shall be conclusive evidence of non-paternity and the Tribal Court shall dismiss the action unless it finds good cause in the child's best interest to allow the matter to go forward; g. If the paternity action was brought by the child's biological mother but she refuses to submit herself or the child to the genetic tests, the action shall be dismissed; and h. Establishment of paternity under this section has no effect on Tribal enrollment or membership. H. Final Paternity Hearing 1. If paternity was not established by voluntary acknowledgment at the initial court appearance, and a genetic test was ordered, a final paternity hearing shall be held where the results of the genetic testing shall be presented unless the parties agree to the establishment of paternity. The hearing shall be held no later than ten (10) days after the receipt of the genetic testing results. 2. Upon the Tribal Court's receipt of the genetic test results, it shall advise the parties of its receipt of the results. The SRMT Court Clerk shall then schedule the matter for a hearing. 3. If the genetic tests results indicate a probability of 99.0% or higher, the SRMT-CSEU shall file a Proposed Order, that: a. Finds the putative father is the biological father based on genetic testing b. Sets conditions for the repayment of any fees or costs associated with the paternity action including, but not limited to, genetic testing, service of process and modification of the official birth record. 4. If genetic tests establish that there is a probability of 98.9% or lower and there has been no showing by the preponderance of the evidence that the putative father named in the Petition is not the biological father, the SRMT-CSEU shall file a Proposed Order that the case be dismissed unless the Court determines there is good cause in the child's best interest to move forward with the hearing. Section V. Establishment of Child Support A. Establishment or Modification of Child Support 1. A parent, child, custodial parent, the child's legal guardian, or the SRMT-CSEU on behalf of the Tribe, may petition the court for the establishment of a child support order. No child support can be ordered unless paternity has been established. B. Petition for the Establishment of Child Support 1. In order to petition for child support, a parent, child, custodial parent, guardian or any other person who is providing financial support and with whom the child(ren) reside shall submit a complete child support application to the SRMT-CSEU. Based on that application, the SRMT-CSEU shall file a petition for an order establishing child support. 2. The petition for establishment of child support shall contain the following information: a. The name, date of birth and tribal affiliation (if known) of the child; b. The names, dates of birth, tribal affiliation (if known) and addresses of the parents in the action. c. If there is a protective order in place, the address of the affected party and of any children shall be redacted from all court documents; or if there is reason to believe that emotional or physical harm may be inflicted should the whereabouts of a party or a child be disclosed, the petitioner shall state the reason and request the Court to issue an Order redacting the personal information from all court documents that respondent can access; d. The amount of the proposed child support requested pursuant to the guidelines provided for in this Act . e. A statement indicating how health insurance and/or medical support is to be provided, whether there are any outstanding medical bills, and whether there are any extraordinary medical expenses for the child(ren); f. A statement indicating whether there are any work-related child care expenses; g. A statement indicating if there has ever been a separate proceeding in another jurisdiction for paternity, custody, placement, or child support involving the subject child(ren); h. A copy of any order entered by another jurisdiction for paternity, custody, placement, or child support; i. A statement as to the current custody, placement and parenting time of the child(ren); j. An official birth certificate, acknowledgment of paternity or court order indicating that the father is named as the legal father of the child or children. A copy of either the official birth certificate, court order or acknowledgment of paternity shall be attached to the petition. If the parties were married at the time of the child(ren)'s birth, then such a statement shall be included in the petition. C. Financial Disclosure 1. Each party to the action shall be required to complete a Financial Disclosure Form and to provide SRMT-CSEU with the disclosure prior to the Mediation as required by Section III (A) (3) . Each party shall sign a confidentiality statement that will require each of them to keep any information learned during the mediation confidential. If a party fails to attend Mediation then each party shall file the Financial Disclosure Form with the Court prior to the initial court appearance. 2. Prior to Mediation, each party shall provide the SRMT-CSEU with the following financial documents: the last two (2) years of income tax returns, W-2s, 1099s, and current pay stubs, if available. If a party fails to attend Mediation then each party shall file the required financial documents to Tribal Court prior to the scheduled initial court appearance. 3. Each party to the action shall complete a Release of Information Authorization which shall allow SRMT-CSEU to obtain additional financial records and to confirm any information provided by a party. 4. The following SRMT entities are required to release information to SRMT-CSEU for the purpose of establishing, modifying or enforcing a child support order: a. All departments of SRMT; b. Akwesasne Housing Authority and Community Development; c. SRMT Tribal enterprises; and d. Any person or entity doing business within the territory of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. 5. If a party declines to participate in Mediation, or otherwise fails to provide the required financial disclosure as outlined above, the Court and SRMT-CSEU will utilize imputed income to determine his/her child support obligation. 6. Financial information shall be kept confidential and full disclosure of information shall be available only to the Court and the SRMT-CSEU. When any financial documents are filed with the Court to be placed in the public docket, the Court shall redact all personal and confidential information such as social security numbers, employee identification numbers, tax identification numbers and all other identifying data. The Court shall order the parties to keep confidential any financial information obtained during the hearing. 7. Any financial information provided to SRMT-CSEU or the Court shall be used for the sole purpose of establishing, modifying, or enforcing child support. D. Child Support Guidelines 1. Every four (4) years, SRMT-CSEU shall prepare a Child Support Standards Chart (CSSC) guideline which shall serve as a guide to parties and the SRMT Court in determining the basic child support obligation. The chart shall be broken down by annual income ranges and by the number of children in a case. It shall establish the upper limit of the combined parental income. To receive an amount of child support above that upper limit the parents can mediate such an amount or the Court can deviate based on the child's needs. 2. A parent's child support obligation shall be established utilizing the annual gross income of the CP and NCP. If a parent's income is unknown or if the parent is unemployed, imputed income may be used when calculating the child support. 3. Child support is based on a percentage of income determined by the number of children as follows: a. 17% for one child; b. 25% for two children; c. 29% for three children; d. 31% for four children; e. No more than 35% for five or more children. 4. Child support obligations may be impacted by a \"Self-Support Reserve\" (SSR) which shall be one hundred thirty-five percent (135%) of the poverty income guidelines amount for a single person as reported by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services and shall be part of the child support calculation. 5. Child support obligations shall be based on the percentages contained in this Section and shall be represented as a whole dollar amount in the Court Order, unless the Court finds good cause to deviate pursuant to Section V(F)(4) from the SRMT CSSC or based on the child's needs. E. Child Support Calculations 1. Worksheet . The Child Support Calculation Worksheet provided for in this Act will determine the proposed amount of child support a parent will be responsible for. The worksheet will be completed utilizing the following steps: a. Determine Total Gross Annual Income of each parent . Total Gross Income is determined by totaling all funds received from any source before taxes or other expenses of any kind are taken out. Total Gross Annual Income does not include public assistance payments or child support received or paid on behalf of children of other relationships b. Determine Total Annual Deductions of each parent . Total Annual Deductions is determined by totaling all deductions from income which include federal, state, and local taxes, state unemployment and disability taxes, and social security taxes, union dues but it does not include deductions such as voluntary retirement contributions and transportation deductions. c. Calculate Annual Net Income of each parent . Annual net income is calculated by subtracting the total annual deductions (b) above from the total gross annual income (a) above. d. Calculate Combined Annual Net Income . Combined Annual Net income is determined by totaling the annual net income of the Custodial Parent's (CP) and Non-Custodial Parent's (NCP) annual net incomes with the maximum outlined in the CSSC of the Combined Annual Net Income. e. Determine the Basic Child Support Obligation . To determine the Basic Child Support Obligation, multiply the Combined Annual Net Income by the appropriate child support percentage listed in the CSSC. f. Determine Proportional Share of Combined Annual Net Income . To determine each parent's proportional share of combined annual net income in order to calculate their proportional share of the basic child support obligation, divide each parent's annual net income by the total combined annual net income. g. Calculate Basic Child Support Obligation without consideration of low-income limitations . To calculate each parent's Basic Child Support Obligation without considering low income limitation, multiply the basic child support obligation by each parent's proportional share of combined annual net income. h. Determine Low Income Limitations . Low income limitations are determined by utilizing the current Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and the Self-Support Reserve (SSR) as reported by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. These limitations are calculated by subtracting each parent's basic child support obligation from their annual net income and then comparing the result with the current FPL and SSR. If the amount falls between the FPL and the SSR, then the presumptive amount will be $25.00 per month ($300.00 annually). If the amount falls below the FPL, then the presumptive amount will be $0.00. If the amount is greater than the SSR, then the low-income limitations do not affect the obligation and the presumptive amount will be the Child Support Obligation as calculated. i. Determine Social Security Offset . If a child is receiving Social Security cash benefits as a result of the parent's disability, the amount owed for child support shall be reduced by the amount of the child's monthly cash benefit. Should the child's monthly cash benefit exceed the amount of the monthly child support obligation there shall be no credit against any child support arrears. j. Offset for other child support obligations . If a parent has more than one child support case, any prior child support obligation shall be deducted from his or her gross income. k. Amount above maximum of CSSC . If the Combined Annual Income is above the statutory amount of the CSSC then the NCP is responsible for the Basic Child Support Obligation and whatever other amount above the statutory amount as agreed between the parents or as determined in the Tribal Court's discretion utilizing the factors from Section V(E)(4). 2. Medical Costs . Medical support may be considered if one or both parents have accessible and affordable health coverage available for the child at a reasonable cost. Reasonable cost is defined as being no more than 5% of a parent's gross income. If a child is eligible for Indian Health Service, the Tribal Court will not establish a medical support order. However, the Tribal Court may require parents to share in the child care expenses and/or extraordinary medical expenses not covered under any policy, plan, or Indian Health Service (IHS). 3. Non-Cash Support . Non-cash support may be considered by the Tribal Court in lieu of cash child support only when agreed upon by both parties. a. In determining whether to permit non-cash support, the Tribal Court shall consider the current circumstances of the parties including whether a non-custodial parent is able to obtain employment, and the availability of other financial resources to meet the current cash child support obligation. b. If a low-income limitation is determined, non-Cash Support may be considered per the SRMT Child Support Guidelines. c. Non-cash support may not be ordered to repay assigned debts owed to a state or tribal jurisdiction. d. All non-cash support orders must describe the type of non-cash support contribution and the SRMT Court must assign a dollar value to the contribution. e. Should a non-cash support contribution not be met, the recipient of the non-cash support is required to notify SRMT-CSEU by the end of each month of the non- compliance in writing. If a notice of non-compliance is not received by the last day of the month, it shall be presumed the non- cash support contribution was met and the payor shall receive a credit based on the Tribal Court Order. F. Child Support Establishment 1. Hearing . If the parties are unable to reach an agreement with respect to the child support and other conditions in Mediation, the hearing shall be held on the date and time shown in the Summons and Petition. At the initial appearance, the Court may enter a temporary based upon the Judge's discretion. 2. Child Support Worksheet . Prior to the parties' appearance the SRMT-CSEU shall file the Child Support Worksheet. After submitting such worksheet, if the SRMT-CSEU receives new information that impacts the child support obligation requested then the SRMT-CSEU shall file a new Child Support Worksheet with the Court with notice being provided to the parties that a new worksheet has been filed. Acceptable forms of notice include a letter to the parties or an email to the parties as long as there is proof of receipt. 3. Order . Following a child support hearing, the Court Order for Child Support shall contain the following information: a. A statement that SRMT has jurisdiction over the child support case and personal jurisdiction over the respondent; b. The amount of child support and any amount to be paid towards arrears, if any exist. Child support arrears may be ordered by the Tribal Court beginning from the date paternity was determined or the date in which the child support petition was filed; c. The amount of work-related non-subsidized daycare or health insurance cost to be paid by the NCP; d. A statement regarding the circumstances under which the child support obligation will terminate; e. A statement that each parent shall notify SRMT-CSEU of any change of employer or address within ten (10) days of said occurrence; f. A statement that if a payor becomes delinquent in an amount equal to one month's child support or fails to follow the terms of the Court Order, any and all enforcement remedies available to SRMT-CSEU under this Act shall be taken; g. An order to seek work if the NCP is unemployed or underemployed; h. That each party may request a review of the support order once every twenty- four (24) months or sooner if there is a change in circumstances warranting a modification; i. If the parties request that child support payments not be made to the SRMT-CSEU pursuant to a Federal Notice of Income Withholding, the Tribal Court will take testimony on how the parties intend to remit payments. If either the CP or NCP demonstrates that there is good cause not to require income withholding, the Court may enter such a finding. However, the order also shall state that if the payor becomes delinquent in an amount equal to one month's child support SRMT-CSEU may issue a Notice of Income Withholding and submit it to the employer or other source of income of the payor; and j. A referral to any program the Court deems just and proper. 4. Deviation . There is a rebuttable presumption that the worksheet calculations are correct to support the requested award of child support. However, the Tribal Court has discretion to deviate from the child support calculation based on substantial evidence that the calculation would be harmful to the parent. If the Court decides to deviate from the calculations, the Court shall state in a written order the amount that would have been ordered had the guidelines been followed and the Court must justify such deviation. The Court may only rely on one or more of the following reason(s): a. The financial resources of the child(ren) and or parent(s) require it; b. One of the parents is a seasonal employee of a trade or profession; c. The party has a verified and documented legal financial obligation to a person other than the child, to make payments, such as extraordinary medical or educational expenses; d. The party has verified and documented extraordinary travel expenses incurred in exercising the right to periods of physical placement or visitation; e. The party has verified and documented extraordinary travel expenses incurred to secure employment; f. The best interests of the child including physical, mental and emotional needs and the child's educational needs; g. The NCP already provides for the child's needs, without a child support order including but not limited to, shelter, food, and extracurricular activities. The NCP shall provide an affidavit attesting to this claim with supporting affidavits from school officials, social service workers, employers, and any other source that can substantiate the claim; or h. An agreement by the parties for a deviation. 5. Default Order . When the respondent fails to appear or fails to answer a Petition filed herein, the Tribal Court shall enter a Default Child Support Order pursuant to Section II D. a. In issuing the Default Order, the Court must also find that the Petition or the recommendation of SRMT-CSEU is based on available, relevant and material financial information and the respondent's child support obligation, at the amount provided for in the Default Order, has been correctly determined under the guidelines and schedule based on calculation of the income provided or based upon the child(ren)'s needs. b. The Default Order shall be served on the respondent by the Tribal Court Clerk per the Service requirements at Section II C . c. A Default Child Support order may be reopened upon motion of the party and such motion to reopen shall be liberally granted for good cause. 6. Modification of Child Support Determination . Any party to an action may request a child support review from SRMT-CSEU to determine if there has been a substantial change in circumstances since the last order for child support or if the child support order has not been reviewed for twenty-four (24) months or more. A substantial change in circumstances includes, but is not limited to, a change in annual income of 15% or a change in the actual residence of a child(ren) has changed. If a modification is justified, the SRMT-CSEU shall file a petition for modification of child support. The petition shall be subject to the same procedures as an initial petition for child support including the requirement for Mediation, a worksheet calculation, and a court hearing to review the petition. 7. Termination of Child Support . Child support shall continue until the child reaches the age of twenty-one (21) years, unless emancipated pursuant to a valid court order. When the child reaches the age of twenty-one (21), the SRMT-CSEU shall file a motion with the Tribal Court to request the termination of any child order. G. Payment of Child Support 1. SRMT-CSEU will be responsible for the receipting, distribution and disbursement of all child support payments pursuant to their IV-D Plan, 2. After an agreement is reached between the parties or the issuance of an order for child support, SRMT-CSEU, if appropriate, will file a Federal Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support (IWO) (Form # OMB0970-0154) and submit to the employer or other source of income of the payor. 3. An IWO shall indicate the amounts to withhold and any additional amounts to repay any arrearages pursuant to the terms of the Order. The employer must submit all amounts withheld to SRMT-CSEU no later than five (5) days following the date the income was withheld. 4. The maximum amounts allowed to be withheld from any source of income shall be no more than fifty percent (50%) of the payor's disposable income available for child support. For the purpose of calculating the amount of income subject to garnishments, Disposable Income means an individual's compensation (including salary, overtime, bonuses, commission, and paid leave) after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required to be deducted by law. Amounts required to be deducted by law may include federal, state and local taxes, state unemployment and disability taxes, social security taxes, and other garnishments or levies, union dues, but does not include such deductions as voluntary retirement contributions and transportation deductions. This requirement shall be so stated in the court order and any SRMT-CSEU correspondence. 5. If the Court has not ordered income withholding, the income of the NCP shall become subject to withholding, at the earliest, on the date when the payments which the NCP has failed to make are at least equal to the support payable for one month. In that case, SRMT- CSEU shall issue a Notice of Income Withholding and submit it to the employer or other source of income of the payor. 6. No employer shall refuse to honor a Notice of Income Withholding or a party's wage withholding request issued under this Act . If the employer fails to withhold income in accordance with the terms contained in the Notice of Income Withholding, the employer may be held liable for all amounts that should have been withheld from the payor. The SRMT-CSEU has the authority and standing as the Tribal agency with authority to enforce this Tribe's interest in child support, to initiate an action to recoup such amounts. The SRMT-CSEU Standard Operating Procedures will provide detail on when and how this will occur. 7. An employer may not discharge, refuse to employ or take disciplinary action against an employee because his or her wages have been subjected to withholding for child support. Failure to comply with this section may subject an employer to appropriate penalties as to be determined under SRMT law or custom. 8. When there is no current child support order and all arrearages have been satisfied, the SRMT-CSEU shall promptly terminate an Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support and provide the employer or other source of income, a termination notice. 9. Parties will be provided with a detailed account statement, broken down by month, annually and upon request. The SRMT-CSEU will promptly refund amounts which have been improperly withheld. 10. The SRMT-CSEU shall allocate withheld amounts across multiple withholding orders to ensure that withholding occurs for each case and does not result in any case not being implemented. H. Enforcement of Child Support Orders 1. Should a payor fail to pay his or her support pursuant to the Tribal Court Order, SRMT- CSEU may report the delinquency to credit bureaus and pursue any other enforcement action available under applicable law. 2. The SRMT-CSEU may take the following enforcement actions by requesting a court order for any or all of the following: a. That any tribally issued licenses or permits, or other forms of \"permission needed\" licenses or permits issued by the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe from the Tribal Council be suspended or revoked; b. That the gaming winnings of the payor be seized; c. That the payor seek work if unemployed or under-employed; d. That the payor attends classes to achieve a high school diploma or equivalent; e. That the payor cooperates with SRMT-CSEU and follow any referrals made for services; f. That the payor's non-essential personal property be seized and sold to pay off the arrears. 3. In the event that any of the foregoing does not result in the payor making his/her child support obligations or in the SRMT-CSEU's discretion any other enforcement efforts are futile the SRMT-CSEU may request assistance from other State and Tribal IV-D agencies to take any actions necessary to collect such support. Such actions may include but are not limited to: a. Seizure of state and federal tax refunds; b. Placement of liens on personal property or real property located off- reservation; c. Passport denial; d. Driver's license and professional license suspension; e. Seizure of bank and other financial accounts; f. A finding contempt and possible incarceration. 4. In the enforcement of any child support order, the following shall be exempt from execution as follows: a. Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TAN-F); b. All wearing apparel of every person in the family except that only $500 in value in furs, jewelry, beadwork and personal ornaments for the person owing the child support obligation; c. Items of bona fide religious or cultural significance; d. Equipment, vehicles, tools, instruments and/or other materials determined by the Court to be necessary to enable the payor to obtain income; e. Any lands within the SRMT reservation that are used by the payor as a primary residence. Section VI. Foreign Orders A. Registration for Enforcement of Foreign Order 1. The SRMT Court shall recognize and enforce any valid child support order that is properly registered with the Tribal Court pursuant to the Federal Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B). 2. Foreign Orders may be registered with the Tribal Court by request of the transferring foreign court or by petition of the SRMT-CSEU. Any requests to the Tribal Court from a foreign jurisdiction for enforcement of a child support order shall be referred to SRMT- CSEU for processing of the petition under this section . B. Petitions for Registration of Order. 1. A petition and proposed order shall be filed with the Tribal Court requesting registration of the foreign child support order. The Petition shall include: a. The name of the petitioner; b. The name of the payor; c. Statement that upon information and belief the payor is an enrolled member or employee of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe; d. The name of the child and other children that the payor may have child support obligations to; e. The amount of arrears, if any; f. A copy of the most recent court order from the foreign jurisdiction for which enforcement is sought; g. The record of payment over the past twelve months; h. The person or entity that should be paid if the petition is granted; i. Any other relevant information that will aid the court. j. Identification of what child support enforcement services are being requested. 2. The Tribal Court shall serve the petition for registration along with a Notice of Registration by certified mail a copy of the petition with the notice of registration to the payor. The payor shall be notified of the right to object in writing to the registration within twenty (20) days of the mailing. The only allowable objection to the recognition and enforcement of a judgment is a mistake of fact or that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. C. Enforcement of Foreign Judgment 1. If twenty (20) days have lapsed and no objection from the payor has been received, the Tribal Court shall issue an order within seven days recognizing the judgment as enforceable 2. The Tribal Court Order shall not allow any modification of the underlying child support order or otherwise change the payment percentage, or other payment amount in the underlying child support order unless the parties agree the originating Court no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction to hear the matter. The foreign court retains exclusive, continuing jurisdiction until neither party nor the child reside there or the parties agree to have SRMT Tribal Court assume jurisdiction. 3. Upon issuance of the Order recognizing the judgment, the SRMT-CSEU shall issue a Federal Notice of Income Withholding and submit the Notice to the employer or other source of income of the payor, if applicable. 4. Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support shall indicate the amounts requested to be withheld and any additional amounts to repay any arrearages pursuant to the terms of the order. The employer must submit all amounts withheld to the SRMT-CSEU no later than five (5) days following the date of withholding from the payer's income. 5. The maximum amounts allowed to be withheld from any source of income shall be no more than fifty percent (50%) of the payor's gross income as outlined above in \u00a7 VG (4). 6. An employer may not discharge, refuse to employ or take disciplinary action against an employee because his or her wages have been subjected to withholding for child support. 7.

The rules set forth below shall govern the requirements for the licensing and reporting of any brewery. The Tribal Council hereby enacts the restrictions, regulations and provisions contained herein for the protection, health, welfare and safety of Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (\"Tribe\"). Policy In order to safeguard the public's safety, the Tribal Council has deemed it necessary to regulate and control the sale and distribution of Alcoholic beverages within the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation (\"Reservation\") to promote temperance in consumption and respect for, and obedience to Tribal Law. It is hereby declared that such policy will best be carried out by empowering the Tribe's Compliance Department to determine whether the issuance of a License pursuant to this Appendix shall promote public convenience and advantage Tribal businesses and whether to increase or decrease the number of such Licenses. When considering a new License application, the Compliance Department also shall consider the proximity of each existing Licensed Premises to the proposed location. The denial of an application is subject only to the right of an Applicant to request the Compliance Department from reconsidering the denial based upon new information. If the Applicant is denied again then he/she can submit its request to Tribal Council for reconsideration.

It shall then be resubmitted as amended to Tribal Council and adopted. Fines and Penalties A.

If an impact is found, the Tribal Clerk shall immediately inform Tribal Council and may make recommendations to ensure continuity of Tribal records, i.e. rescission of prior resolutions and cross-referencing. c. The Tribal Council shall decide whether to adopt a TCR by considering whether the resolution is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, whether the proposed TCR falls within the scope of the Tribal Council's authority and may consider any other factors it deems necessary. 2. The Tribal Clerk shall keep one copy of the proposed TCR and shall keep a record of all TCRs passed, amended, or rescinded. 3. Solely at Tribal Council's discretion, it may request community review of a TCR prior to presenting it in the Work Session. This community review shall not exceed thirty (30) business days. a.

If the resolution does not receive the requisite number of votes, it shall fail and may only be presented again by requesting that either a Chief or a Sub-Chief sponsor the re-presentation of the TCR at the next work session. G. Amendment and Rescission 1. Any resolution may be amended or rescinded if the Tribal Council determines that to do so would be in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. An amending or rescinding TCR shall be passed in a Work Session, shall be recorded and the Tribal Clerk shall be directed to cross-reference amending and rescinding resolutions accordingly.

Short Title This ordinance shall be known as the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Land Assignment Ordinance. Its short title shall be the \"Land Assignment Ordinance\". Section B. Findings The St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Council (\"Council\" or \"Tribal Council\") hereby finds that: (1) Due to the unique legal status of lands on the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation (\"Reservation\"), it is difficult for members of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe (\"Tribe\") to purchase homes utilizing traditional financing methods. (2) In order to alleviate this situation, which exists on all Indian reservations and lands, federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") have established Indian housing loan guarantee programs. (3) In order for the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe and its members to participate in any mortgage loan program, whether guaranteed or conventional for either residential or commercial purposes, it must first establish the required legal and administrative framework to allow for Reservation land parcels to be used as a security interest for mortgages. (4) Currently, individual tribal member land interests on the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation are held pursuant to a tribal member's Deed of Right to Use and Occupancy that is approved by the Tribal Council and filed with the Tribal Clerk's office. Section C. Purpose The purpose of this ordinance is to convert and structure the current land interests into tribal land assignments so that such may be pledged as security for a mortgage; and to create a land assignment process to protect the interests of the tribal member borrower, the lender, and any federal agency that is involved.

(2) In order to alleviate this situation, which exists on all Indian reservations and lands, Federal Agencies such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") have established Indian housing loan guarantee programs. (3) In order for the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe and its members to participate in any mortgage loan programs, whether guaranteed or conventional, for either residential or commercial purposes it must first establish the required legal and administrative framework to protect the interests of borrowers, lenders, and federal agencies which guarantee or mortgage loans. (4) One of the requirements for any mortgage loan program is to adopt adequate and clear foreclosure and eviction procedures to ensure a remedy for lenders in the event of a default. Section C.

Definitions There are no words or phrases that require statutory definition as part of this enactment. Section IV. [Rule 1] Scope and Applicability A. These Rules govern proceedings in the Tribal Court of the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation. B. These Rules apply to civil actions and proceedings, to criminal cases and proceedings, to contempt proceedings and to juvenile proceedings. C. These Rules do not apply to preliminary examinations in criminal cases; sentencing, or granting or revoking probation or parole; issuance of warrants for arrest; criminal summonses and search warrants; and proceedings covering release on bail.

The Tribal Court shall look to the Federal Rules of Evidence for guidance on any matter not covered by these Rules. Section V. [Rule 2] Rulings on Evidence A. Effect of Erroneous Ruling. Error may not be predicated on a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and 1. Objection. In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike is made and appears on the record, stating the specific ground for the objection, if such is not obvious from the context; or 2. Offer of Proof. In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the Court by offer of proof or was apparent from the context within which the questions were asked. B. Record of Offer and Ruling. The Court may add any other or further statement which shows the character of the evidence, the form in which it was offered, the objection made, and the ruling. The Court may direct the making of an offer of proof in question and answer form. C. Hearing of the Jury. In jury cases, proceedings shall be conducted to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in the hearing of the jury.

[Rule 3] Preliminary Questions A. Questions of Admissibility Generally. Preliminary questions concerning the qualifications of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the Court, subject to the provisions of subdivision of this Rule. In making its determination, the Court is not bound by the Rules of Evidence except those pertaining to privileges. B. Relevancy Conditioned on Fact. When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the Court shall admit it subject to the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding that the condition of fact was fulfilled. C. Hearing of the Jury. Hearings on the admissibility of confessions shall in all cases be conducted out of the hearing of the jury. Hearing on other preliminary matters shall be conducted when the interests of justice require, or when an accused is a witness and requests a hearing. D. Testimony by Accused. The accused does not, by testifying upon a preliminary matter, become subject to cross-examination as to other issues in the case. E. Weight and Credibility. This Rule does not limit the right of a party to introduce before the jury evidence relevant to weight or credibility. Section VII. [Rule 4] Limited Admissibility When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the Court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury. Section VIII. [Rule 5] Relevancy and Its Limits / Definition: Generally Admissible A. \"Relevant evidence\" means evidence having a tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. B. All evidence is generally admissible, except as otherwise provided by Ordinances, by acts of the Tribal Council, by these rules or other rules prescribed by the Court pursuant to statutory authority. C. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible. Section IX. [Rule 6] Exclusion of Relevant Evidence Evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury or it will cause undue delay, waste of time or be a needless presentation of cumulative evidence. Section X. [Rule 7] Character Evidence Not Admissible to Prove Conduct; Exceptions; Other Crimes A. Generally. Evidence of the character or character trait of a person is not admissible if it is to be used to prove conduct or for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion.

[Rule 9] Habit; Routine Practice Evidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of eye witnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice. Section XIII. [Rule 10] Subsequent Remedial Measures If after an event measures are taken which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of the measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct, a defect in a product, a defect in a product's design, or a need for a warning or instruction in connection with the event. This Rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted or impeached.

However, such a statement is admissible (a) in any proceeding when another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced and the statement ought, in fairness, be considered contemporaneously with it, or (b) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record and in the presence of counsel. Section XVII. [Rule 14] Liability Insurance Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue of whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully.

[Rule 16] Privileges / Policy It is the policy of the Tribal Court to encourage and foster relationships of trust and confidence.

Generally the privilege does not cease upon the termination of the relationship. C. The privilege does not extend to communications in furtherance of an illegal purpose or fraud. D. Communications not made in confidence, e. g., intended to be relayed to third parties, made in the presence of third parties, etc., are not within the privilege. E.

B. Specific instances of conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting his credibility, may only be inquired into on cross examination, concerning the witness' truthfulness or untruthfulness.

Disputes involving contracts (i) negotiated, executed, or performed in Mohawk Indian Country, or (ii) whose subject matter substantially involves Mohawk Indian Country, or (iii) under which substantial performance would occur in Mohawk Indian Country, or (iv) in which the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (\"Tribe\") or any of its subordinate entities, agencies, or agents is a party (except that this provision does not waive Tribal sovereign immunity); C.

B. The officers, agents (including Tribal attorneys), and employees of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe are immune from suit for acts of omission within the scope of their official capacity and for acts or omissions which such officers, agents (including Tribal attorneys), or employees reasonably believed to be within their official capacity. C. Nothing in this Civil Code shall be interpreted as waiving or diminishing the sovereign immunity of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe or of its subordinate entities, agencies, officers, agents, or employees. D. Tribal sovereign immunity is hereby found and stated to be an essential element of self-determination and self-government, and as such will be waived by the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council only under such circumstances as the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council finds to be in the interests of the Tribe in promoting economic or commercial development or for other Tribal purposes. Any such specific waivers of sovereign immunity as may from time to time be executed must be clear, explicit and in writing; any such waivers shall be interpreted narrowly and limited to the explicit terms of the waivers; and any such waivers shall not by implication or interpretation be extended in any manner or fashion beyond their narrow, explicit terms.

F. The Mohawk Tribe does not assert sovereign immunity against claims for equitable relief brought in Mohawk Court (and only in Mohawk Court) under the federal Indian Civil Rights Act, but such claims may not be brought against individual Indians or officers, agents or employees of the Tribe and such claims must be limited to non-monetary (injunctive or declaratory) relief. Section V. Applicable Law A. Civil disputes over which the Tribal Court has jurisdiction shall be decided by the Court in accordance with and by applying the following principles of law in the priority and precedence in which the principles of law are first identified below (higher priority and precedence being accorded those identified earliest in the list, so that in the event of inconsistency or conflict between principles of law, the principle of law identified earlier in the list shall be relied upon as the controlling principle for deciding the dispute): 1. Such portions of the Constitution of the United States and federal law are clearly applicable in Mohawk Indian Country (with great weight given at all times to principles of the United States Constitution and federal Indian law which recognize Indian sovereignty, self-determination, and self-government, which render many federal and state laws inapplicable to federal Indian Country, which provide for a federal trust responsibility to Indian tribes, and which provide rules of legal interpretation favorable to Indian tribes); 2. Written Mohawk laws adopted by the recognized governmental system of the Mohawk Tribe; 3. Unwritten Mohawk laws, and written and unwritten Mohawk customs, traditions and practices, whenever such Mohawk laws, customs, traditions or practices are found by the Mohawk Court to be (i) well-established within the Tribe and recognized by Tribal members, (ii) applicable or relevant to the dispute in issue, and (iii) not inconsistent with due process and other rights established under Tribal law; 4. Generally recognized principles of the law of contracts (including quasi-contracts or imperfectly formed invalid contracts), as reflected by the most recent Restatement of Contracts or in such expert treatises as the Court may choose to recognize or as the Court may otherwise determine; 5. Generally recognized principles of the law of torts, as reflected by the most recent Restatement of Torts or in such expert treatises as the Court may choose to recognize or as the Court may otherwise determine; 6. If (but only if) consistent with principles of Tribal sovereignty, self- government, and self-determination, and if (but only if) consistent with principles of law identified earlier in this section , New York State laws on contracts and torts. B. Principles of New York State law for resolving private civil disputes are not automatically applied in Mohawk Courts. Principles of New York State law for resolving private civil disputes may be applied in Mohawk Courts for the purpose of resolving a private civil dispute over which the Mohawk Court has jurisdiction if (but only if) the Mohawk Court finds: (i) there is no other controlling principle of Mohawk law; (ii) application of the New York State law is consistent with principles of Tribal sovereignty, self-government, and self-determination; and (iii) application of the New York State law is in the overall interest of justice and fairness to the parties. Section VI. Practice, Procedure and Organization A. Rules of Procedure Until the Court adopts its own rules of procedure or when not otherwise in conflict with a specific rule adopted by the Tribal Court or the Tribal Council, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall be deemed to be the rules of procedure for the Tribal Court, but the Court may modify, set or direct any specific rule or procedure for individual cases as the Court deems appropriate. B. Rules of Evidence Until the Court adopts its own rules of evidence or when not otherwise in conflict with a specific rule adopted by the Tribal Court or the Tribal Council, the Federal Rules of Evidence shall be deemed to be the rules of evidence for the Tribal Court, but the Court may modify, set or direct any specific rule for individual cases as the Court deems appropriate and may accept such evidence as it deems useful in the interests of justice. C. Appearance and Practice before the Court Any party may represent himself, herself or itself, so long as the Court determines that the party is reasonably competent to comprehend and participate effectively in the proceedings. Any person may be admitted to practice before the Court for the purpose of representing clients therein if the person meets the requirements set forth by the Tribal Court for practice before the Court and the requirements established by any applicable Tribal code or ordinance. D. Assigning and Deciding Cases A case shall be assigned to a single Judge of the Tribal Court, but another Tribal Court Judge may from time to time handle various aspects of the case upon the request of the primary Judge as considerations of scheduling, workload, and the like may make such temporary assignment convenient and in the interests of justice. All aspects of cases (including preliminary procedures, motions, and trials) shall be decided by one Tribal Court Judge; civil cases will not be decided by jury trial except if allowed by a specific Tribal ordinance. E. Service of Process Process may be served by any Mohawk Tribal police officer, by any adult (not interested in the case), or by certified mail with return receipt executed by recipient. The Court may set aside claimed service of process when it finds the process was not in fact received. Section VII. Judicial Power and Enforcement of Judgments A. The Tribal Court is hereby further empowered with the inherent judicial authority which is necessary and proper to decide civil disputes over which it has jurisdiction (except as otherwise limited in this Code, is limited by the scope of its jurisdiction, and as limited by Tribal sovereign immunity). B. The Tribal Court may enforce its judgments using methods and procedures commonly recognized for such enforcement in United States courts, provided that in all enforcement proceedings due process is accorded the parties. When not inconsistent with Mohawk law, custom and practice with Tribal sovereignty and self-determination, enforcement procedures commonly recognized in New York State courts may be utilized by the Tribal Court.", "num": "2008-19", "path": "library|us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions|2008|Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res.

The time within which a civil lawsuit must be filed shall be counted from the date on which the injury or breach was first known to the injured party or should have been known to a reasonably aware person in the position of the injured party. C. For the purposes of meeting the deadline set in this Rule, a civil suit is started when the complaint is filed with the Clerk of the Court. Section IX. [Rule 6] Commencement of a Lawsuit; Complaints; Proof of Service; Filing Fee; Summons A. To start a civil lawsuit in Tribal Court, a person shall first file a written complaint with the Court Clerk. The person who has filed the complaint shall be known as the plaintiff in the lawsuit. The complaint shall describe the injury or breach the plaintiff is complaining of, name or describe the person responsible for such injury or breach, who shall be known as the defendant, and state the relief requested. The plaintiff shall sign the complaint and have the document notarized. If a person is unable to prepare a written complaint, the Clerk may help that person complete a complaint form provided by the Rules of the Court. B. After the plaintiff has filed the complaint, the Clerk shall issue a summons directing the defendant to answer the complaint within twenty (20) days of the time the defendant receives the complaint and summons. The summons shall be on the official form provided by the Rules of the Court. The summons must notify the defendant that a failure to appear and defend will result in a default judgment being entered against the defendant for the relief demanded in the complaint. C. Within sixty (60) days after plaintiff files a civil complaint, plaintiff shall cause a copy of the complaint, together with the summons, to be served upon (delivered to) each defendant named in the complaint. The complaint and summons must be served by a person eighteen (18) or more years old who has no stake in the outcome of the lawsuit. It may be served either by giving it to the defendant directly or by leaving it at a defendant's residence or place of employment with a person at least fourteen (14) years old who lives or works there. D. The person who delivers the complaint shall sign and file a proof of service with the Clerk. The proof of service shall indicate the type of document served, the date and place of service, and the name of the person served, and shall be on the form provided for that purpose by the Rules of the Court. This shall be done within thirty (30) days from the date of service. E. Every person who files a civil lawsuit shall pay a filing fee to be established by the Rules of the Court. Section X. [Rule 7] Amendment, Withdrawal, Dismissal of the Complaint A. A plaintiff may change the complaint without Court permission at any time before the defendant answers it, as long as a copy of the changed complaint is delivered to all parties according to the rules for complainants. After the defendant has answered the complaint, the judge may still allow plaintiff to change the complaint as long as allowing the change would not be unfair to the defendant. B. The Judge shall allow plaintiff to withdraw the complaint and shall dismiss the case at any time plaintiff requests unless the defendant has counterclaimed against plaintiff, or dismissal of the case would otherwise be unfair to the defendant. The judge may order a plaintiff who withdraws a complaint to pay to the defendant all costs of the suit incurred by the defendant. Section XI. [Rule 8] Defenses, Answers; Counterclaims A. Within twenty (20) days after a defendant receives a copy of a civil complaint and summons, he or she must answer the complaint in writing. The Defendant must sign the answer, file it with the Clerk, and cause it to be served upon and delivered to the plaintiff If the defendant is not able to prepare a written answer, he or she shall explain to the Clerk the nature of the defense which will be presented, and the Clerk shall help the defendant to put the answer in writing, on the form provided for that purpose by the Rules of the Court. B. In addition to or as a way of raising a defense to the complaint, a defendant may file a complaint/counterclaim against plaintiff, following the same rules which apply to complaints. Section XII. [Rule 9] Preliminary Injunctions and Temporary Restraining Orders A. A party to a civil suit may ask the judge for a pretrial order (injunction) prohibiting or requiring particular action by another party to keep things as they are until the Court has a chance to reach a final decision in the case. The order shall be granted if the person requesting it shows that there is a good chance that he or she will win the suit and that he or she will suffer irreparable loss or injury if the injunction is not issued. B. Unless otherwise stated in the injunction, a pretrial injunction shall remain in effect until final judgment in the case. C. Except as provided in Section 12 , Rule 9(d), no pretrial injunction shall be issued unless the party to be enjoined first has notice and an opportunity to be heard in court. D. A judge may issue a temporary restraining order prohibiting or requiring particular action by a party to keep things as they are pending the court's final decision in the case without prior notice to the party to be restrained when the party who requests such an order provides by sworn statement or oral testimony that he or she will suffer permanent loss or injury if the order is not issued before the opposing party can be notified and heard and that he or she made a reasonable attempt to notify the opposing party of the time when the request would be made. E. A temporary restraining order shall be effective only for the time period specified in the order, and in no case for longer than ten (10) days. Subject to the requirements of Section 12 , Rule 9(d), a temporary restraining order may be renewed once and only for good cause. F. The judge may require a party who requests a restraining order or pretrial injunction to provide security for any loss or injury which may be suffered by a party who is wrongfully enjoined or restrained; provided, however, that the judge shall not require such security from the Tribal government or any of its branches or instrumentalities. Section XIII. [Rule 10] Default A. Failure of a defendant to file and serve an answer upon the plaintiff within twenty (20) days after the complaint was served shall be in default and shall provide grounds for judgment against the defendant as asked for in the complaint. No judgment of default shall be made, however, unless the plaintiff makes a written motion for a default judgment and serves a copy of the motion on each defendant. If defendant files an answer to the complaint at or before the time that the motion is to be argued to the Judge, no default judgment shall be granted, and the matter shall proceed as though answered on time. If defendant does not answer by that time, a default judgment shall be entered. B. In granting a default judgment, the Judge may refuse to grant relief requested by plaintiff if granting the relief would be contrary to Tribal law or would be unjust. The judge may not grant plaintiff greater relief on default than was requested in the complaint. Section XIV. [Rule 11] Discovery A. It is the policy of the Tribal Court that the truth will be revealed if all parties in a civil case have access to all information and evidence related to the case. In preparation for trial the parties may ask each other for and shall make available to each other all information in each other's possession or control which will be used as evidence in the case or which can reasonably be expected to lead to evidence. B. Methods of discovering and exchanging information may include but need not be limited to written questions, oral examination, requests for witness' names, requests for admissions, physical inspection of property, requests to perform scientific or physical tests, and requests for documents. The party who makes a request under this Rule shall be as clear and as specific as possible in describing what he or she wants. C. A party may refuse to make available the information requested pursuant to this Rule if its release would cause the responding party or a third person undue hardship, annoyance, or embarrassment, or would violate a confidence which is Tribal custom or official Tribal policy to protect. If parties disagree about whether the responding party is required to release the information, the judge shall decide the dispute. The Judge may place conditions on the release of information to protect confidential material, prevent unreasonable burden or expense to one party, or otherwise ensure fairness to all parties. D. A party who receives a request for information under this Rule shall, within ten (10) days of receiving the request, respond either with information, with an indication where and when the information will be available, or with an objection and refusal to comply with the request. Failure to respond within ten (10) days is grounds for a Court order requiring a response. E. A copy of all written requests for discovery shall be filed with the Court. Section XV. [Rule 12] Pretrial Conference A. In the interest of saving time, simplifying the issues and avoiding unnecessary litigation, the Judge may, on his or her own motion, or on the motion of any party, schedule one or more pretrial conferences with all parties to a case. In any case determined by the Judge to be complex, at least one pretrial conference shall be held after the completion of discovery and early enough to aid parties in planning for trial. B. The pretrial conference shall be held in an informal setting and shall be conducted without formal procedures. The parties and the Judge shall discuss areas where the parties are in agreement and areas where they disagree. The purpose of the discussion shall include the following: 1. To identify and dispose of issues which may be resolved without a trial; 2. To narrow and focus issues of law which remain to be decided and to identify central acts which are still in dispute; 3. To limit the number of witnesses and the evidence that will be presented so that testimony and other evidence is not repetitious or irrelevant; and 4. To avoid surprise at trial. C. To accomplish the above purposes, all parties to a lawsuit shall, at the pretrial conference after discovery, fully disclose: 1. The names and addresses of all witnesses they expect to present at trial, and the basic information to which they expect the witness to testify; 2. All documents they expect to introduce as evidence, and the basic information which they intend to prove with those documents; and 3. All objects which they intend to introduce as evidence and the basic information which they intend to prove with those objects. D. No party shall be permitted to use the testimony of any witness or introduce as evidence any document or object unless they disclose the witness, document, or object at the pretrial conference as provided in (c) above, unless the party proves that at the time of the pretrial conference they were unaware of the existence or nature of the witness, document or object and could not, with reasonable effort, have discovered it in time to disclose it. Such evidence must, in any case, be disclosed to the judge and opposing party as soon as possible before it may be offered in the trial. E. No offer of settlement or other statement which is made by a party during a pretrial conference may be used as evidence against that party if settlement is not then achieved. Agreements reached as a result of a pretrial conference shall be put in writing and signed by all parties. Such agreement shall be made part of the final judgment issued by the judge. Section XVI. [Rule 13] Motions A. Any questions regarding procedure or the rights of the parties which arise during a lawsuit and which cannot be settled by agreement of the parties may be presented to the judge in a motion, which is a request for an order. B. Motions may be made in writing or orally. If the motion is not made during and as a consequence of events at a trial or other hearing, the moving party shall notify other parties of the nature and basis of the motion and the hearing time at least ten (10) days before the motion is presented in Court, so the responding party has a chance to plan a response. The notice required by this section shall be called a Notice of Motion, shall be in writing, and shall be served upon the party, or, if the party is represented by counsel, upon the party's counsel, according to Section 4 , Rule 1 (b). Persons who are unable to prepare their own written Notice of Motion may be assisted by the Clerk in the filling out of a Notice of Motion form, provided for that purpose by the Rules of the Court. C. Motions to dismiss the lawsuit because the Court lacks jurisdiction or because the plaintiff has not stated a legitimate basis for relief may be made at any time. All other pretrial motions which would determine the procedures used at trial must be made at least five (5) days before the trial. The judge may deny a motion which could and should have been made earlier in the case if it appears that the moving party knew or should have known earlier about the basis for the motion and has raised it late because of negligence or an intent to harass the other party. Section XVII. [Rule 14] Compelling Witnesses to Appear; Subpoenas A. Any party to a lawsuit or other proceeding in Tribal Court shall have the right to compel witnesses to appear in Court and testify concerning the matter. B. Upon request of a party, the Court shall issue a subpoena, an order which commands a named person to appear in Court and/or to bring certain evidence or documents to court. C. All subpoenas shall be signed by a judge, except as otherwise provided by the Rules of the Court. D. Every subpoena shall be in writing and shall include the name of the Court, the Court's seal, the names of all parties, the time and place that the witness must appear, and a clear and detailed description of any documents or evidence that the witness is required to bring. E. Subpoenas shall be delivered to the witness by a person of the age of eighteen (18) or more years who has no stake in the case. The subpoena must be delivered by giving it to the witness directly. F. A person who delivers a subpoena shall promptly file with the Clerk a copy of the subpoena and a proof of service as defined in Section 9 , Rule (6)(d). The proof of service must be filed prior to the date the person is to appear, and in any event no more than thirty (30) days after the date of service. G. Failure of a witness to obey a subpoena shall be grounds for holding the witness in contempt of Court after a hearing. H. A witness who responds to a civil subpoena shall be entitled to a fee of Thirty Dollars ($30.00) for each day or partial day that he or she must appear in court. The judge may, in addition, order that the witness be paid reasonable and necessary travel and living expenses incurred in responding to the subpoena. Witnesses shall be offered full payment of their fees for one day's service at the time they are served with the subpoena. The party requesting the issuance of a subpoena shall tender the fees to the witness upon service of the subpoena. Section XVIII. [Rule 15] Jury Trials A. Jury request; fee. A jury trial shall be held if requested by either party to the case at least ten (10) days before the trial, and only if specifically allowed by applicable Tribal law. The party who requests a jury trial shall pay to the Court a jury fee established by the Rules of the Court. Payment of the jury fee may be waived by the Chief Judge upon the request of a party if payment of the fee would result in severe hardship to the party. The party who requests a jury trial or a visiting judge who fails to provide at least five (5) days notice by a written motion to continue shall be liable for the payment of jury fees and fees payable to the visiting judge at the discretion of the Judge presiding over the trial. B. Eligibility; jury list. To be eligible to serve as a juror on a civil case, a person must be a Tribal member who is a resident of the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, must be eighteen (18) years of age or older, must never have been convicted in any court of a felony, and must not at the time the list is made, or at the time of trial, be holding the office of Tribal judge, Tribal police officer, or Tribal Council Member. 1. For the purposes of this section , a permanent resident of the Reservation is a person who rents or owns a dwelling place on the reservation, and who resides in that dwelling place other than seasonally or periodically, and who receives mail on the reservation at a reservation post office box or reservation street address, and who intends to make the reservation his or her permanent home for the future, and who does not claim residence in any other location for any purpose. 2. The Tribal Clerk shall prepare each year a list of persons eligible to serve as jurors, and shall provide the jury list to the Clerk of the Court. The Clerk of the Court shall prepare a ballot in the name of each eligible person and protect the ballots from access by unauthorized persons by placing the ballots in a master ballot box and securing the master ballot box in a safe. C. Selection of panel; jury summons; failure to appear; excuse from jury duty. 1. Not less than seven (7) days before the date set for the beginning of a jury trial, the judge shall draw from the master ballot box, at random, the number of ballots specified by the Rules of the Court for a civil jury trial of the type scheduled. The Clerk of the Court shall then issue and cause to be served upon each person whose ballot was drawn a Jury Summons. 2. The Jury Summons shall notify the person being summoned to appear in Court on the date set for the beginning of the trial, one hour before the time set for the trial. Failure of a person served with a Jury Summons to appear shall constitute contempt of court and the Summons shall contain a warning to that effect. Any person for whom jury service would be a severe hardship may be excused from service by a judge, but such excuse from jury duty shall be disfavored. D. Jury selection. On the day of the trial, the Clerk shall deposit in a ballot box ballots containing the names of each of the summoned potential jurors who have appeared by the time set for their appearance. Those persons whose names are in the ballot box shall be known as the jury panel. After the Judge calls the Court to order, he or shall draw from the jury panel ballot box, at random, the names of fourteen (14) members of the jury panel, who shall then be seated in the jury area. The Clerk shall make a list of the names in the order in which they are called. E. Removal for cause; examination by Court, parties. 1. After the first fourteen (14) members of the jury panel have been seated, the judge shall examine each of them as to their qualifications, and excuse any who appear to him or her to be biased, prejudiced, unable to fairly and effectively perform the duties of a juror or otherwise not qualified to serve as juror. The judge shall permit the parties or their counsel to similarly examine and ask for the removal of jurors for cause, without any limit to the number of jurors so challenged or removed, except that all such challenges must be in good faith. The judge shall excuse any juror he or she believes to be unqualified, directing him or her to leave the jury area. 2. After all the disqualified jurors have been excused from the jury area, enough additional ballots shall be drawn by the judge to replace the disqualified persons with members of the jury panel. The Clerk shall add their names to the list in the order in which they were called. The procedure for challenge for cause shall continue until fourteen (14) qualified persons are seated in the jury area. F. Peremptory Challenges. After the fourteen (14) qualified persons have been seated in the jury area, each party shall have the right to remove three persons from the jury without stating any reason. The parties shall alternatively remove jurors, or waive their turn to do so, until they have exhausted their peremptory challenges. G. Trial jury; alternate. The Clerk of the Court shall then read aloud the first seven (7) names on the list and those persons shall be jurors for the trial. The Clerk shall also read aloud the eighth (8th) name on the list, and that person shall be an alternate juror for the trial. The alternate juror shall act in all respects as a juror, except that he or she shall not vote during jury deliberations unless one of the other jurors has been excused by the judge during the course of the trial. Section XIX. [Rule 16] Order of Trial A. At the trial of a civil case, presentations shall be made in the following order unless otherwise agreed by the parties or determined at the pretrial conference: 1. Motions by either party regarding procedure at trial, evidence to be presented, jurisdiction of the Court, or the sufficiency of claim; 2. Evidence and statements presented by the party (the plaintiff) who filed the original complaint; 3. Evidence, statements or motions presented by the person complained against (the defendant); 4. Motions of either party which are based on events at trial; and 5. Final arguments by both parties. B. The judge may announce a final decision at the close of trial or may take the matter under submission and issue a written decision at a later time. All decisions shall be announced within thirty (30) days after the end of the trial. Section XX. [Rule 17] Burden and Standard of Proof; Jury Verdicts A. Unless otherwise provided by Tribal law, the burden of providing a civil claim shall be on the party who makes the claim. B. Unless otherwise provided by Tribal law, a party to a civil case shall be considered to have met the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence standard. This shall mean the necessary party met the burden of proof by providing superior evidentiary weight that, though not sufficient to free the mind wholly from all reasonable doubt, is still sufficient to incline a fair and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than the other. C. A civil jury verdict must be based upon the agreement of at least six (6) of the seven (7) jurors. Section XXI. [Rule 18] Rules of Evidence Governing Trials A. Purpose. The purpose of these informal Rules of Evidence is to ensure that the Tribal Court is able to determine the truth of a matter with a minimum of delay, confusion, and uncertainty of the parties. B. General Rules. 1. Where there is more than one kind of evidence about the same subject, the judge shall give each item of evidence the importance (weight) which, according the judge's common sense and sense of fairness, that particular type of evidence deserves. For example, in oral testimony, the testimony of persons who testify from their personal knowledge, such as first-hand observation of, or participation in, the event described shall be given more weight than the testimony of persons who only have knowledge of the event that they gained from other persons. 2. Evidence admitted in the Tribal Court must be related either to the issues before the court or to the weight and credibility which should be given to other evidence. When questioned by the judge or another party as to why certain evidence should be allowed, the party who wishes to present the evidence shall: (a) State the issue which he or she will use the evidence to resolve; and (b) Explain how the evidence is relevant to the issue. (c) When the relevance or reliability of evidence is challenged, the judge shall decide whether or not to use the evidence, and explain the decision. C. Oaths. Prior to testifying before the Tribal Court, every witness shall first state before the judge, parties and spectators that he or she will testify truthfully. The Court may prescribe an oath for this purpose by the Rules of the Court. D. Questioning Witnesses. 1. When questioning a witness, the judge and parties or their counsel shall not ask questions in such a way as to suggest the answer, unless the witness is one who was called by the opposing party, or is clearly hostile to the person asking questions. 2. The judge shall determine the order in which the parties or their counsel shall be allowed to question witnesses. The judge shall protect the witnesses from harassment or unnecessarily repetitious or irrelevant questioning. 3. During the questioning of a witness, the judge may exclude from the Court room any witnesses who have not yet testified, if this seems to be necessary to ensure that all witnesses will give truthful testimony. At the request of any party, such witness shall be excluded. 4. The Judge may call and/or question any witnesses on his or her own initiative. E. Sworn Written Testimony: Subject to the provisions of Section 21 , Rule 18 (b) (2), testimony of a witness may be presented in sworn written form if and only if: 1. The witness is unable to appear in person to testify, or 2. If the evidence presented in writing is not contradicted by other parties, or 3. If the sworn written testimony is offered to support a motion or an uncontested request for relief, or 4. If the sworn written testimony contradicts oral testimony already given by the same witness. 5. Written testimony must show clearly who gave it and when the witness gave it. Notarized documents are favored. 6. Copies or written records, photographs, and other documentary evidence may be presented as long as there is a reasonably reliable way to identify the items and the methods used to prepare them. 7. When the relevance or reliability of evidence is challenged, the Judge shall decide whether or not to use the evidence, and explain the decision. Section XXII. [Rule 19] Judgments A. A judgment is a final order of the Court which disposes of a claim in whole or in part. The Judge may announce a judgment orally at a hearing in open Court before the parties, or in writing, at the time of hearing or after the hearing, but in no case more than thirty (30) days after the end of the trial. B. Finality: A judgment becomes final when it has been recorded in the Docket Book by the court Clerk. The Court shall establish, by the Rules of the Court, the length of time after issuance of an order within which the Court Clerk must enter the Order in the Docket Book. Section XXIII. [Rule 20] Proceedings After Judgment A. No later than ten (10) days after a judgment is final, a party may ask the Judge for a rehearing, reconsideration, correction, vacation, or modification of the judgment. B. The Judge may grant a new hearing or reconsider any change in the judgment if he or she finds at least one of the following to be true: 1. The original judgment was based on or reached as a result of fraud or mistake of law; 2. There is newly discovered evidence which probably would have affected the outcome of the case and which could not, with reasonable effort, have been discovered in time for a hearing of the case; 3. The court did not have jurisdiction over a party or over the subject matter. C. No later than ten (10) days after judgment is final or no later than ten (10) days after a motion made pursuant to Section (a) of this Rule is denied, a party may appeal an adverse judgment as provided in the Rules of Appellate Procedure. D. No civil judgment shall be enforced sooner that thirty (30) days after judgment is entered in the docket. E. Failure to abide by the decision of the Court for resolution of the action, within a reasonable time as may be determined by the Court, will result in a \"letter of warning\" from the Court Clerk. Further non-compliance may result in a judgment for Contempt of Court, and enforcement of the original decision will be determined by the Court through such measures as garnishment of wages, restraining orders on bank accounts, sale offer implement liens on personal and/or real property, or any other remedy as authorized by the law. F. A party appealing a judgment against him or her, or filing a motion pursuant to Section 23 , Rule 20(a) may make a motion requesting that the Court delay (stay) enforcement of the judgment until after the Section 23 , Rule 20(a) motion or appeal has been decided. The party who won the original judgment may oppose the motion for a stay and/or may request that the Court require that the party asking for the stay post a bond to protect him or her from further damage, to cover costs, or to guarantee that sufficient assets are within the control of the Court to satisfy the judgment if the original winning party wins the motion or the appeal. Stays shall be granted only under the terms of this Section and the Rules of Appellate Procedure, and no stays shall be granted automatically. Section XXIV. [Rule 21] Costs A. Upon judgment, the Judge shall order the losing party to pay to the winning party the costs of the lawsuit, unless the applicable law provides otherwise or the judge determines that such an order would be unjust. Costs shall not be imposed on the Tribe or any branch of the Tribe unless specifically permitted by an applicable Tribal law or agreement. B. Costs shall include civil filing fees, any costs for delivering documents required by these Rules to be delivered, postage for court notice sent to the parties, and fees and expenses paid to witnesses and jurors, but shall not include counsel fees unless Tribal law so provides in a particular type of case. C. No person shall be jailed because he or she is unable to pay costs. Section XXV. [Rule 22] Interpretation and Publication of Rules of Civil Procedure The Tribal Court may apply interpretation of like provisions in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in construing these rules. The Tribal Court may authorize special, as well as annotated editions of these Rules of Civil Procedure, together with any requirement for citations of practice before the Tribal Courts. Section XXVI. Provisions as Cumulative The provisions of this Ordinance shall be cumulative to existing law. Section XXVII. Repeal Provisions and Conforming Amendments A. No provisions of law are expressly repealed by this enactment. B. No current or previous provisions of law are conformed by this enactment. Section XXVIII. Severability The provisions of this Ordinance are severable and if any part or provision shall be held void by any Court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of the Court shall not affect or impair any of the remaining parts or provisions of this Ordinance .", "num": "2008-20", "path": "library|us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions|2008|Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res.

Unless there is a reasonable basis to determine otherwise , all great-grandparents listed as Saint Regis Mohawk (fourth generation) of an applicant shall be deemed 100% Saint Regis Mohawk if : (a) they are presently enrolled Saint Regis Mohawk tribal members or were enrolled Saint Regis Mohawk tribal members at the time of their death, or; (b) if their names appeared on any applicable/official Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Census Rolls, or; (c) the last names of one or either of the applicants' great grandparents are names that are readily recognizable as being Saint Regis Mohawk. If none of the above requirement can be fulfilled then there shall be a reasonable basis for additional research to be conducted to determine whether or not the great grandparents (fourth generation) can be identified as Saint Regis Mohawk or not. Such research may include conducting a review of the applicant's family history beyond the fourth generation. II. For purposes of calculating Saint Regis Mohawk blood quantum and in order to determine whether an applicant has fulfilled the requisite twenty five percent (25%) blood quantum required for Eligibility, Enrollment and Membership with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, the Tribal Clerk shall: (a) determine the Saint Regis Mohawk blood quantum of each parent of applicant in accordance with the above, and; (b) divide the Saint Regis Mohawk blood quantum of each parent by one-half (1/2), and; (c) combine/add the Saint Regis Mohawk blood quantum Of each parent to determine the Saint Regis Mohawk blood quantum of applicant. Determinations of Saint Regis Mohawk blood quantum may result in an amount that is less than the requisite twenty five percent (25%) necessary for Eligibility, Enrollment and Membership with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. Notwithstanding this fact, an individual whose blood quantum is below the requisite twenty five percent (25%) may still use such amount to calculate the eligibility of that individual's biological children, if applicable.

Filing a certificate under this section shall be deemed to be an amendment of the certificate of formation of each limited liability company affected thereby, and each such limited liability company shall not be required to take any further action with respect thereto to amend its certificate of formation under \u00a7 202 of this ordinance .

If such limited liability company fails to obtain and designate a new registered agent as aforesaid prior to the expiration of the period of 30 days after the filing by the registered agent of the certificate of resignation, the certificate of formation of such limited liability company shall be deemed to be canceled.

(b) In case the officer whose duty it is to serve legal process cannot by due diligence serve the process in any manner provided for by subsection (a) of this section , it shall be lawful to serve the process against the limited liability company upon the Secretary, and such service shall be as effectual for all intents and purposes as if made in any of the ways provided for in subsection (a) of this section . In the event that service is effected through the Secretary in accordance with this subsection, the Secretary shall forthwith notify the limited liability company by letter, certified mail, return receipt requested, directed to the limited liability company at its address as it appears on the records relating to such limited liability company on file with the Secretary or, if no such address appears, at its last registered office.

Section 108.

A manager's or a liquidating trustee's serving as such constitutes such person's consent to the appointment of the registered agent of the limited liability company (or, if there is none, the Secretary) as such person's agent upon whom service of process may be made as provided in this section . Such service as a manager or a liquidating trustee shall signify the consent of such manager or liquidating trustee that any process when so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon such manager or liquidating trustee within the Reservation and such appointment of the registered agent (or, if there is none, the Secretary) shall be irrevocable. As used in this subsection (a) and in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section , the term \"manager\" refers (i) to a person who is a manager as defined in \u00a7 101(10) of this ordinance and (ii) to a person, whether or not a member of a limited liability company, who, although not a manager as defined in \u00a7 101(10) of this ordinance , participates materially in the management of the limited liability company; provided however, that the power to elect or otherwise select or to participate in the election or selection of a person to be a manager as defined in \u00a7 101(10) of this ordinance shall not, by itself, constitute participation in the management of the limited liability company. (b) Service of process shall be effected by serving the registered agent (or, if there is none, the Secretary) with 1 copy of such process in the manner provided by law of the Tribe for service of writs of summons or, if there is no manner provided by law of the Tribe for service of a writ of summons, then by registered United States mail. In the event service is made under this subsection upon the Secretary, the plaintiff shall pay to the Secretary the sum of $50 for the use of the Tribe, which sum shall be taxed as part of the costs of the proceeding if the plaintiff shall prevail therein. In addition, the Tribal Court Clerk in which the civil action or proceeding is pending shall, within 7 days of such service, deposit in the United States mails, by registered mail, postage prepaid, true and attested copies of the process, together with a statement that service is being made pursuant to this section , addressed to such manager or liquidating trustee at the registered office of the limited liability company and at the manager's or liquidating trustee's address last known to the party desiring to make such service. (c) In any action in which any such manager or liquidating trustee has been served with process as hereinabove provided, the time in which a defendant shall be required to appear and file a responsive pleading shall be computed from the date of mailing by the Tribal Court Clerk as provided in subsection (b) of this section ; however, the Tribal Court in which such action has been commenced may order such continuance or continuances as may be necessary to afford such manager or liquidating trustee reasonable opportunity to defend the action. (d) (1) Subject to paragraph 2 of this subsection, in a written limited liability company agreement or other writing, a manager or member must, at a minimum, consent to be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribal Court and may, in addition, consent to be subject to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or arbitration in, a specified jurisdiction, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribal Court, or the exclusivity of arbitration in a specified jurisdiction or within the Reservation, and to be served with legal process in the manner prescribed in such limited liability company agreement or other writing. Except by agreeing to arbitrate any arbitrable matter in a specified jurisdiction or within the Reservation, a member who is not a manager may not waive its right to maintain a legal action or proceeding in the Tribal Court with respect to matters relating to the organization or internal affairs of a limited liability company. (2) Paragraph 1 of this subsection does not apply to any limited liability company in which the Tribe, Te W\u00e0 Tha H\u00f3n:Ni Corporation, or an instrumentality of the Tribe or wholly-owned entity of the Tribe is a member. As to such limited liability companies, in a written limited liability company agreement or other writing, a manager or member must, at a minimum, consent to be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribal Court and may, in addition, consent to be subject to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or arbitration in, a specified jurisdiction, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribal Court, or the exclusivity of arbitration in a specified jurisdiction or within the Reservation, and to be served with legal process in the manner prescribed in such limited liability company agreement or other writing, but only as to suits or to arbitration between or among the limited liability company, its members, and/or the Tribe, and not as to any third parties. Any such limited liability company, or a member of such limited liability company that is the Tribe, Te W\u00e0 Tha H\u00f3n:Ni Corporation, or an instrumentality of the Tribe or wholly-owned entity of the Tribe, may consent to suit by third parties pursuant to \u00a7 303(c) of this Ordinance . (e) Nothing herein contained limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner now or hereafter provided by law. This section is an extension of and not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal process upon nonresidents. (f) The Tribal Court may make all necessary rules respecting the form of process, the manner of issuance and return thereof and such other rules which may be necessary to implement this section and are not inconsistent with this section . Section 110. Contested Matters Relating to Managers; Contested Votes (a) Upon application of any member or manager, the Tribal Court may hear and determine the validity of any admission, election, appointment, removal or resignation of a manager of a limited liability company, and the right of any person to become or continue to be a manager of a limited liability company, and, in case the right to serve as a manager is claimed by more than 1 person, may determine the person or persons entitled to serve as managers; and to that end make such order or decree in any such case as may be just and proper, with power to enforce the production of any books, papers and records of the limited liability company relating to the issue. In any such application, the limited liability company shall be named as a party and service of copies of the application upon the registered agent of the limited liability company shall be deemed to be service upon the limited liability company and upon the person or persons whose right to serve as a manager is contested and upon the person or persons, if any, claiming to be a manager or claiming the right to be a manager; and the registered agent shall forward immediately a copy of the application to the limited liability company and to the person or persons whose right to serve as a manager is contested and to the person or persons, if any, claiming to be a manager or the right to be a manager, in a postpaid, sealed, registered letter addressed to such limited liability company and such person or persons at their post-office addresses last known to the registered agent or furnished to the registered agent by the applicant member or manager. The Tribal Court may make such order respecting further or other notice of such application as it deems proper under these circumstances. (b) Upon application of any member or manager, the Tribal Court may hear and determine the result of any vote of members or managers upon matters as to which the members or managers of the limited liability company, or any class or group of members or managers, have the right to vote pursuant to the limited liability company agreement or other agreement or this Ordinance (other than the admission, election, appointment, removal or resignation of managers). In any such application, the limited liability company shall be named as a party and service of the application upon the registered agent of the limited liability company shall be deemed to be service upon the limited liability company, and no other party need be joined in order for the Tribal Court to adjudicate the result of the vote. The Tribal Court may make such order respecting further or other notice of such application as it deems proper under these circumstances. (c) Nothing herein contained limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner now or hereafter provided by law. This section is an extension of and not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal process upon nonresidents. Section 111.

Together with the actual delivery of a certificate and tender of the required fees, there is delivered to the Secretary a separate affidavit (which in its heading shall be designated as an affidavit of extraordinary condition) attesting, on the basis of personal knowledge of the affiant or a reliable source of knowledge identified in the affidavit, that an earlier effort to deliver such certificate and tender such fees was made in good faith, specifying the nature, date and time of such good faith effort and requesting that the Secretary establish such date and time as the date and time of filing of such certificate; or b. Upon the actual delivery of a certificate and tender of the required fees, the Secretary in the Secretary's own discretion provides a written waiver of the requirement for such an affidavit stating that it appears to the Secretary that an earlier effort to deliver such certificate and tender such fees was made in good faith and specifying the date and time of such effort; and c. The Secretary determines that an extraordinary condition existed at such date and time, that such earlier effort was unsuccessful as a result of the existence of such extraordinary condition, and that such actual delivery and tender were made within a reasonable period (not to exceed 2 business days) after the cessation of such extraordinary condition, then the Secretary may establish such date and time as the date and time of filing of such certificate. No fee shall be paid to the Secretary for receiving an affidavit of extraordinary condition. For purposes of this subsection, an extraordinary condition means: any emergency resulting from an attack on, invasion or occupation by foreign military forces of, or disaster, catastrophe, war or other armed conflict, revolution or insurrection or rioting or civil commotion in, the United States or a locality in which the Secretary conducts its business or in which the good faith effort to deliver the certificate and tender the required fees is made, or the immediate threat of any of the foregoing; or any malfunction or outage of the electrical or telephone service to the Secretary's office, or weather or other condition in or about a locality in which the Secretary conducts its business, as a result of which the Secretary's office is not open for the purpose of the filing of certificates under this Ordinance or such filing cannot be effected without extraordinary effort. The Secretary may require such proof as it deems necessary to make the determination required under this subparagraph of subdivision (a)(6), and any such determination shall be conclusive in the absence of actual fraud. If the Secretary establishes the date and time of filing of a certificate pursuant to this subsection, the date and time of delivery of the affidavit of extraordinary condition or the date and time of the Secretary's written waiver of such affidavit shall be endorsed on such affidavit or waiver and such affidavit or waiver, so endorsed, shall be attached to the filed certificate to which it relates. Such filed certificate shall be effective as of the date and time established as the date and time of filing by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection, except as to those persons who are substantially and adversely affected by such establishment and, as to those persons, the certificate shall be effective from the date and time endorsed on the affidavit of extraordinary condition or written waiver attached thereto.

Section 208. Restated Certificate (a) A limited liability company may, whenever desired, integrate into a single instrument all of the provisions of its certificate of formation which are then in effect and operative as a result of there having theretofore been filed with the Secretary 1 or more certificates or other instruments pursuant to any of the sections referred to in this Chapter , and it may at the same time also further amend its certificate of formation by adopting a restated certificate of formation. (b) If a restated certificate of formation merely restates and integrates but does not further amend the initial certificate of formation, as theretofore amended or supplemented by any instrument that was executed and filed pursuant to any of the sections in this Chapter , it shall be specifically designated in its heading as a \"Restated Certificate of Formation\" together with such other words as the limited liability company may deem appropriate and shall be executed by an authorized person and filed as provided in \u00a7 206 of this ordinance in the office of the Secretary. If a restated certificate restates and integrates and also further amends in any respect the certificate of formation, as theretofore amended or supplemented, it shall be specifically designated in its heading as an \"Amended and Restated Certificate of Formation\" together with such other words as the limited liability company may deem appropriate and shall be executed by at least 1 authorized person, and filed as provided in \u00a7 206 of this ordinance in the office of the Secretary.

A restated certificate shall also state that it was duly executed and is being filed in accordance with this section . If a restated certificate only restates and integrates and does not further amend a limited liability company's certificate of formation as theretofore amended or supplemented and there is no discrepancy between those provisions and the restated certificate, it shall state that fact as well. (d) Upon the filing of a restated certificate of formation with the Secretary, or upon the future effective date or time of a restated certificate of formation as provided for therein, the initial certificate of formation, as theretofore amended or supplemented, shall be superseded; thenceforth, the restated certificate of formation, including any further amendment or changes made thereby, shall be the certificate of formation of the limited liability company, but the original effective date of formation shall remain unchanged. (e) Any amendment or change effected in connection with the restatement and integration of the certificate of formation shall be subject to any other provision of this Ordinance , not inconsistent with this section , which would apply if a separate certificate of amendment were filed to effect such amendment or change.

In connection with a merger or consolidation hereunder, rights or securities of, or interests in, a domestic limited liability company or other business entity which is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity or, in addition to or in lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, a domestic limited liability company or other business entity which is not the surviving or resulting limited liability company or other business entity in the merger or consolidation or may be cancelled. Notwithstanding prior approval, an agreement of merger or consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a provision for such termination or amendment contained in the agreement of merger or consolidation. (c) If a domestic limited liability company is merging or consolidating under this section , the domestic limited liability company or other business entity surviving or resulting in or from the merger or consolidation shall file a certificate of merger or consolidation executed by 1 or more authorized persons on behalf of the domestic limited liability company when it is the surviving or resulting entity in the office of the Secretary.

(e) A certificate of merger or consolidation shall act as a certificate of cancellation for a domestic limited liability company which is not the surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation. A certificate of merger that sets forth any amendment in accordance with subsection (c)(4) of this section shall be deemed to be an amendment to the certificate of formation of the limited liability company, and the limited liability company shall not be required to take any further action to amend its certificate of formation under \u00a7 202 of this title with respect to such amendments set forth in the certificate of merger. Whenever this section requires the filing of a certificate of merger or consolidation, such requirement shall be deemed satisfied by the filing of an agreement of merger or consolidation containing the information required by this section to be set forth in the certificate of merger or consolidation. (f) An agreement of merger or consolidation approved in accordance with subsection (b) of this section may: (1) Effect any amendment to the limited liability company agreement; or (2) Effect the adoption of a new limited liability company agreement, for a limited liability company if it is the surviving or resulting limited liability company in the merger or consolidation.

Section 407. Delegation of Rights and Powers to Manage Unless otherwise provided in the limited liability company agreement, a member or manager of a limited liability company has the power and authority to delegate to 1 or more other persons the member's or manager's, as the case may be, rights and powers to manage and control the business and affairs of the limited liability company, including to delegate to agents, officers and employees of a member or manager or the limited liability company, and to delegate by a management agreement or another agreement with, or otherwise to, other persons.

Chapter V Finance Section 501. Form of Contribution The contribution of a member to a limited liability company may be in cash, property or services rendered, or a promissory note or other obligation to contribute cash or property or to perform services. Section 502. Liability for Contribution (a) Except as provided in a limited liability company agreement, a member is obligated to a limited liability company to perform any promise to contribute cash or property or to perform services, even if the member is unable to perform because of death, disability or any other reason. If a member does not make the required contribution of property or services, the member is obligated at the option of the limited liability company to contribute cash equal to that portion of the agreed value (as stated in the records of the limited liability company) of the contribution that has not been made. The foregoing option shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights, including the right to specific performance, that the limited liability company may have against such member under the limited liability company agreement or applicable law. (b) Unless otherwise provided in a limited liability company agreement, the obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property paid or distributed in violation of this Ordinance may be compromised only by consent of all the members. Notwithstanding the compromise, a creditor of a limited liability company who extends credit, after the entering into of a limited liability company agreement or an amendment thereto which, in either case, reflects the obligation, and before the amendment thereof to reflect the compromise, may enforce the original obligation to the extent that, in extending credit, the creditor reasonably relied on the obligation of a member to make a contribution or return. A conditional obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property to a limited liability company may not be enforced unless the conditions of the obligation have been satisfied or waived as to or by such member. Conditional obligations include contributions payable upon a discretionary call of a limited liability company prior to the time the call occurs. (c) A limited liability company agreement may provide that the interest of any member who fails to make any contribution that the member is obligated to make shall be subject to specified penalties for, or specified consequences of, such failure. Such penalty or consequence may take the form of reducing or eliminating the defaulting member's proportionate interest in a limited liability company, subordinating the member's limited liability company interest to that of nondefaulting members, a forced sale of that limited liability company interest, forfeiture of the defaulting member's limited liability company interest, the lending by other members of the amount necessary to meet the defaulting member's commitment, a fixing of the value of the defaulting member's limited liability company interest by appraisal or by formula and redemption or sale of the limited liability company interest at such value, or other penalty or consequence.

Section 504. Allocation of Distributions Distributions of cash or other assets of a limited liability company shall be allocated among the members, and among classes or groups of members, in the manner provided in a limited liability company agreement.

Section 505. Defense of Usury Not Available No obligation of a member or manager of a limited liability company to the limited liability company arising under the limited liability company agreement or a separate agreement or writing, and no note, instrument or other writing evidencing any such obligation of a member or manager, shall be subject to the defense of usury, and no member or manager shall interpose the defense of usury with respect to any such obligation in any action. Chapter VI Distributions and Resignation Section 601. Interim Distributions Except as provided in this Chapter , to the extent and at the times or upon the happening of the events specified in a limited liability company agreement, a member is entitled to receive from a limited liability company distributions before the member's resignation from the limited liability company and before the dissolution and winding up thereof.

Notwithstanding that a limited liability company agreement provides that a manager does not have the right to resign as a manager of a limited liability company, a manager may resign as a manager of a limited liability company at any time by giving written notice to the members and other managers. If the resignation of a manager violates a limited liability company agreement, in addition to any remedies otherwise available under applicable law, a limited liability company may recover from the resigning manager damages for breach of the limited liability company agreement and offset the damages against the amount otherwise distributable to the resigning manager. Section 603. Resignation of Member A member may resign from a limited liability company only at the time or upon the happening of events specified in a limited liability company agreement and in accordance with the limited liability company agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under applicable law, unless a limited liability company agreement provides otherwise, a member may not resign from a limited liability company prior to the dissolution and winding up of the limited liability company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under applicable law, a limited liability company agreement may provide that a limited liability company interest may not be assigned prior to the dissolution and winding up of the limited liability company. Section 604. Distribution upon Resignation Except as provided in this Chapter , upon resignation any resigning member is entitled to receive any distribution to which such member is entitled under a limited liability company agreement and, if not otherwise provided in a limited liability company agreement, such member is entitled to receive, within a reasonable time after resignation, the fair value of such member's limited liability company interest as of the date of resignation based upon such member's right to share in distributions from the limited liability company. Section 605. Distribution in Kind Except as provided in a limited liability company agreement, a member, regardless of the nature of the member's contribution, has no right to demand and receive any distribution from a limited liability company in any form other than cash. Except as provided in a limited liability company agreement, a member may not be compelled to accept a distribution of any asset in kind from a limited liability company to the extent that the percentage of the asset distributed exceeds a percentage of that asset which is equal to the percentage in which the member shares in distributions from the limited liability company. Except as provided in the limited liability company agreement, a member may be compelled to accept a distribution of any asset in kind from a limited liability company to the extent that the percentage of the asset distributed is equal to a percentage of that asset which is equal to the percentage in which the member shares in distributions from the limited liability company. Section 606. Right to Distribution Subject to \u00a7\u00a7 607 and 804 of this ordinance , and unless otherwise provided in a limited liability company agreement, at the time a member becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of a limited liability company with respect to the distribution. A limited liability company agreement may provide for the establishment of a record date with respect to allocations and distributions by a limited liability company. Section 607. Limitations on Distribution (a) A limited liability company shall not make a distribution to a member to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the limited liability company, other than liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specified property of the limited liability company, exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited liability company, except that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the limited liability company only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability. For purposes of this subsection (a), the term \"distribution\" shall not include amounts constituting reasonable compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary course of business pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits program. (b) A member who receives a distribution in violation of subsection (a) of this section , and who knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated subsection (a) of this section , shall be liable to a limited liability company for the amount of the distribution. A member who receives a distribution in violation of subsection (a) of this section , and who did not know at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated subsection (a) of this section , shall not be liable for the amount of the distribution. Subject to subsection (c) of this section , this subsection shall not affect any obligation or liability of a member under an agreement or other applicable law for the amount of a distribution. (c) Unless otherwise agreed, a member who receives a distribution from a limited liability company shall have no liability under this Ordinance or other applicable law for the amount of the distribution after the expiration of 3 years from the date of the distribution unless an action to recover the distribution from such member is commenced prior to the expiration of the said 3-year period and an adjudication of liability against such member is made in the said action.

(b) Unless otherwise provided in a limited liability company agreement: (1) An assignment of a limited liability company interest does not entitle the assignee to become or to exercise any rights or powers of a member; (2) An assignment of a limited liability company interest entitles the assignee to share in such profits and losses, to receive such distribution or distributions, and to receive such allocation of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit or similar item to which the assignor was entitled, to the extent assigned; and (3) A member ceases to be a member and to have the power to exercise any rights or powers of a member upon assignment of all of the member's limited liability company interest.

(c) Unless otherwise provided in a limited liability company agreement, a member's interest in a limited liability company may be evidenced by a certificate of limited liability company interest issued by the limited liability company.

To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the right to receive any distribution or distributions to which the judgment debtor would otherwise have been entitled in respect of such limited liability company interest. (b) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's limited liability company interest. (c) This Ordinance does not deprive a member or member's assignee of a right under exemption laws with respect to the judgment debtor's limited liability company interest. (d) The entry of a charging order is the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or of a member's assignee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's limited liability company interest. (e) No creditor of a member or of a member's assignee shall have any right to obtain possession of, or otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies with respect to, the property of the limited liability company.

SAINT REGIS MOHAWK TRIBE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The law firm of McNamee, Lochner, Titus &amp; Williams, P.C., was selected in March, 1996 to provide legal support and assistance to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, Environment Division, in developing an Akwesasne Wetlands Conservation Act (referred to below as the \"Act\"). The Act is designed to work in concert with the existing Wetlands Protection Plan and Environmental Assessment Procedure to comprehensively regulate and protect the critical Wetland resources of Akwesasne. When an applicant identifies potential wetlands impacts during the environmental assessment procedure, the requirement to submit a Wetlands Permit Application is triggered. In concert, these ordinances will provide the Environment Division with powerful tools to guide development and preserve environmental quality. In order to develop the Wetlands Act, Counsel to the Environment Division examined the Wetland protection plans of other Tribes, the Federal government, and New York State. Counsel worked with Environment Division staff, and in particular the Wetlands Biologist, to develop a Wetlands protection plan that protects the wetland ecosystems that have since time immemorial been central to Akwesasne culture. The Act consists of essentially five (5) elements. These elements are: policy, mapping of wetlands, public notice, permitting, and enforcement. Titles I and II set forth in clear terms the important policies that drive Wetland protection, and charge the Environment Division with the task of identifying Wetlands areas on the Reservation and publishing a Wetlands map. Through the diligent efforts of Environment Division staff, working closely with their consultants, the work of identification and mapping has been substantially completed. Title III sets forth the Wetlands Permitting Plan. In order to protect and preserve Wetlands for present and future generations, any person desiring to conduct on designated Wetlands any activity regulated under the Act must apply to the Environment Division for a Permit. By requiring Permit applications to be submitted to the Environment Division prior to development, the Tribe can impose conditions on such development, as needed, in order to guide growth in a manner that is protective of Tribal resources. Certain activities consistent with traditional, cultural uses of Wetlands are excepted from the Permit requirement. Included amongst the excepted activities are the collection, harvest and growth of medicinal and other plants. As part of its responsibilities under the Act, the Environment Division shall compile a list of medicinal plants, shrubs and herbs found in the Wetlands of Akwesasne. Thereafter, any person engaged in the collection, harvest or growth of such plants, shrubs and herbs shall be exempt from the permitting requirements. Also excepted, although subject to certain conditions, are traditional home-builder activities affecting less than .25 acres of Wetlands. Title IV establishes an Environmental Appeals Board. In an attempt to achieve balance and consensus regarding Wetlands and Water Quality protection, the Board is proposed to be staffed by representatives from the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Environment Division, the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Council, the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne, the Mohawk Nation of Chiefs, and three at-large members. The Board is empowered to hear appeals from Environment Division orders and permitting decisions in order to assure that all affected are provided with due process of law. The Board's review of the decisions of the Environment Division as they pertain to Wetlands is not unlimited, but empowers the Board to decide only the five issues enumerated in section 01-0402(2) of the Act. The Act will serve to protect the Wetlands and Water Quality of Akwesasne from undue encroachment and over-development. By regulating the human impact in the Wetlands, the Act will improve the quality of these ecosystems by returning them to their traditional state of balance. AKWESASNE WETLANDS CONSERVATION ACT TITLE I GENERAL PROVISIONS AND PUBLIC POLICY Section 01-0101. Declaration of Policy It is the public policy of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe to preserve, protect and conserve wetlands and the benefits that they provide, to prevent the pollution and destruction of wetlands, and to regulate the use and development of such wetlands to secure to the people of Akwesasne their natural benefits, consistent with the general welfare and beneficial economic, social, cultural and agricultural development of Akwesasne. Section 01-0102. Statement of Findings 1. The wetlands of Akwesasne have since time immemorial played a critical role in sustaining Akwesasne cultural traditions, health and welfare. 2. Considerable acreage of freshwater wetlands in Akwesasne has been lost, polluted or impaired by unregulated draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution or other acts inconsistent with the natural uses of such areas. The wetlands that remain are in jeopardy of being lost, destroyed or impaired by such unregulated acts. 3. Wetlands conservation is a matter of Tribal concern, calling for uniform Tribal regulation since a wetland in one region of Akwesasne is affected by acts on rivers, streams and wetlands of other regions. 4. Any loss of wetlands deprives the people of Akwesasne of some or all of the many and multiple benefits to be derived from wetlands, including, but not limited to: (a) flood and storm control by the hydrologic absorption and storage capacity of wetlands; (b) protection of subsurface water resources and provision for valuable watersheds and recharging ground water supplies; (c) pollution treatment by serving as biological and chemical oxidation basins; (d) erosion control by serving as sedimentation areas and filtering basins, absorbing silt and organic matter and protecting channels and harbors; (e) education of future generations by providing readily accessible outdoor bio-physical laboratories, living classrooms and vast training and education resources; (f) open space and aesthetic appreciation by providing areas for hunting, gathering, fishing, canoeing, bird-watching and camping often in the only remaining open areas along increasingly crowded river fronts; (g) provision of critical wildlife habitat; and (h) support of valuable medicinal plants and trees of cultural and economic importance including, but not limited to, Heartweed ( Polygonum persicaria ) and BlackAsh ( Fraxinus nigra ). 5. Regulation of wetlands, in accordance with the exceptions established in \u00a7 01-0301 of this ordinance, is consistent with the legitimate interests of farmers and other landowners to graze and water livestock, make reasonable use of water resources, harvest natural products and medicinal plants of the wetlands, selectively cut timber and otherwise engage in the use of land for agricultural purposes. Section 01-0103. Definitions 1. \" Board \" shall mean the Akwesasne Environmental Appeals Board. 2. \" Environment Division \" means the Environment Division of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe. 3. \" Person \" shall mean any corporation, firm, partnership, association, trust, estate, one or more individuals, and any unit of Tribal government or an agency or subdivision thereof. 4. \" Pollution \" shall mean the presence in the environment of conditions induced by humanity or any substances in quantities or characteristics which are or may be injurious to human, plant or wildlife, or other animal life or to property. 5. \" Wetlands \" means lands and waters of Akwesasne as shown on the wetlands map and that are seasonally or permanently flooded by shallow water as well as lands where the water table is close to the surface; in either case the presence of abundant water has caused the formation of hydric soils and has favored the dominance of either hydrophytic or water tolerant plants which are dependant upon or tolerant of very moist conditions. Wetlands may or may not contain species that are of value culturally to the Mohawks of Akwesasne. Lands that are under active agricultural use that are periodically flooded, soaked, or wet are not considered to be wetlands by definition. (a) Wetlands are comprised of marshes, bogs, swamps and fens supporting aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation: (i) \" Marshes \" are wet areas periodically inundated with standing or slowly moving water and/or permanently inundated areas characterized by emergent herbaceous vegetation, and to a lesser extent, anchored floating plants and submergents. (ii) \" Bogs \" are peat covered areas or peat filled depressions with a high water table and a surface carpet of acidophilic mosses (chiefly Sphagnum). The water table is at or near the surface in the spring, and slightly below during the remainder of the year. (iii) \" Swamps \" are wooded wetlands including both forest swamps and thicket swamps, with 25% cover or more of tall trees and shrubs. In swamps, standing to gently flowing waters occur seasonally or persist for long periods on the surface. (iv) \" Fens \" are peat accumulating wetlands characterized by surface layers of poorly to moderately decomposed peat, often with well decomposed peat near the base. They are generally covered by a dominant component of sedges although grasses and reeds may be present. Fens receive some drainage from surrounding mineral soil and supports marsh-like vegetation. (v) \" Wooded Wetlands \" are wetlands dominated by trees; a forested wetland. (vi) \" Wet Meadows \" are grasslands with nearly saturated soil near the surface, but without standing water for most of the year. (vi) \" Open Water \" refers to water that is free of emergent vegetation or artificial obstructions. (vii) \" Emergent Wetland \" refers to wetlands dominated by mostly herbaceous emergent vegetation. (viii) \" Forested Wetlands \" are defined by the presence of trees which mostly cover the site (see, \"Wooded Wetlands\"). (ix) \" Scrub/Shrub Wetlands \" exhibit wetland soils and hydrogeology, and are populated largely by shrubs, bushes or brush which are persistent year to year. (x) \" Reed Swamps \" refers to marshes dominated by Phragmites (common reed). (xi) \" Slough \" refers to an elongated marsh often bisected by a creek with slowly flowing surface water. (xii) \" Pot Hole \" refers to a shallow, marsh-like pond. (xiii) \" Peatland \" is a generic term for any wetland that accumulates partially decayed plant matter. 6. \" Emergent \" means rising above a surrounding medium, as in wetland plants protruding above the water level. 7. \" Wetlands map \" shall mean a map promulgated by the Environment Division by their authority under \u00a701-0201 of this article on which is indicated the general boundaries of any wetlands. TITLE II WETLANDS STUDIES: NOTIFICATION AND MAPS Section 01-0201. Wetlands Inventory 1. The Environment Division shall complete a study to identify and map, to the extent practicable, the wetlands of Akwesasne (the \"Wetlands Inventory\"). 2. Upon completion of the wetlands inventory, the Environment Division shall prepare a tentative wetlands map outlining the boundaries of such wetlands as determined by the study and inventory conducted under subdivision ( 1 ) of this section . 3. The tentative wetlands map shall set forth the general boundaries of such wetlands as accurately as is practicable to inform the landowners, the Tribe, and the Environment Division of the approximate location of the wetlands. 4. Upon completion of the tentative wetlands map, the Environment Division shall hold a public hearing in order to afford an opportunity for any person to propose additions or deletions from such map. The Environment Division shall assure that a copy of the relevant map is available for public inspection at a convenient location, no more than thirty nor less than 10 days before the public hearing. The Environment Division shall also issue notice of the public hearing in a local newspaper, at least once, no later than 10 days prior to the hearing. 5. After considering the rights of affected property owners and the ecological balance in accordance with the policy and purposes of this article , the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Council shall promulgate by order the final wetlands map. A copy of the order, together with a copy of the wetlands map shall be filed in the offices of the Environment Division, and will be available for public review at a location or locations found by the Environment Division to be most publicly accessible. The Environment Division shall also publish a final notice of promulgation in a local newspaper. 6. Upon completion, the Environment Division may readjust the map to clarify the boundaries of the wetlands, to correct any errors in the map, to make any additions, deletions or technical changes in the map, and to reflect changes that have occurred from the granting of permits pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 01-0301 and 01-0302 of this article , or natural changes which may have occurred through erosion, accretion, wildlife activity, storm events, or otherwise. Notice of such readjustment shall be given in the same manner as set forth in subdivision ( 4 ) of this section for the promulgation of the final wetlands map. 7. The Environment Division may, upon its own initiative, and in its sole discretion, identify more precisely the boundary line or lines of a wetland or portion thereof. Such more precise identification shall be of appropriate scale and sufficient clarity to permit the ready identification of individual buildings and of other structures or facilities or significant geographical features with respect to the boundary of any wetland. In making its determinations under the Act , the Environment Division may consider the results of any additional delineations funded by individual applicants. TITLE III WETLANDS REGULATIONS Section 01-0301. Permits 1. After issuance of the official wetlands map, any person desiring to conduct on wetlands designated on the map any of the regulated activities set forth in subdivision two of this section must obtain a permit as required by this title. 2. Activities subject to regulation shall include any form of draining, dredging, excavation, removal of soil, mud, sand, shells, gravel or other aggregate from any wetland, either directly or indirectly; erecting any structures, roads, the driving of pilings, or placing of any other obstructions whether or not changing the ebb and flow of the water; any form of pollution, including but not limited to, installing a septic tank, running a stormwater or sanitary sewer outfall, discharging sewage treatment effluent or other liquid wastes into or so as to drain into a wetland; and any other activity which substantially impairs any of the several functions served by wetlands or the benefits derived from wetlands which are set forth in section 01-0102(5) of this article . These activities are subject to regulation whether or not they occur upon the wetland itself, if, in the discretion of the Environment Division, they inhibit or otherwise substantially affect the function of the wetlands and/or are located within 100 feet from the boundary of such wetland as indicated on the wetlands map. Section 01-0302. Non-Prohibited Discharge of Dredged or Fill Material 1. The following activities are not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation under the Act ; (a) The selective removal of the natural products of the wetlands by recreational and commercial fishing, shellfishing, aquaculture, silviculture, hunting or trapping shall be excluded from regulated activities, where otherwise allowed pursuant to Akwesasne cultural traditions, laws or regulations; (b) The activities of farmers and other landowners in grazing and watering livestock, making reasonable use of water resources, selective harvesting of natural products of the wetlands, selectively cutting timber, draining land or wetlands for growing agricultural products and otherwise engaging in the use of wetlands or other land for growing agricultural products shall be excluded from regulated activities; (c) The Environment Division shall develop and publish a list of medicinal plants, shrubs and herbs found in the wetlands of Akwesasne. Any person engaged in the collection, harvest or growth of such plants for non-commercial consumption shall be exempt from the permitting requirements of this chapter; (d) Maintenance, including emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of currently serviceable structures such as dikes, dams, levees, groins, riprap, breakwaters, causeways and bridge abutments or approaches, and transportation structures; (e) Construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, or the maintenance of drainage ditches; (f) Construction of temporary sedimentation basins on a construction site which does not include placement of fill material into the navigable waters; (g) Construction or maintenance of farm roads or forest roads, or temporary roads for moving mining equipment, where such roads are constructed and maintained, in accordance with best management practices, to assure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the navigable waters are not impaired, that the reach of the navigable waters is not reduced, and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be otherwise minimized; (h) Prior Converted Farmlands. The Environment Division finds that due to the pressures of outside forces, certain lands once converted to agricultural uses, have been left fallow, and for various reasons may know fall within the regulatory definition of Wetlands. The Environment Division may, on a case by case basis and in its sole discretion, exempt activities taking place on such prior converted farmlands from any or all parts of the Act . In order to qualify for the exemption, the applicant must present to the Environment Division some credible evidence of the use of the particular parcel as farmlands. In making its determinations under this subsection, the Environment Division shall favor conversion to agricultural and residential uses over conversion for commercial uses. (i) Single-Family Housing. Discharges of dredged or fill material into wetlands for the construction and expansion of a single-family home and attendant features (such as a garage, driveway, storage shed, and/or septic field) is allowed for an individual permittee provided the activity meets all of the following criteria: (a) The discharge does not cause the loss of more than 1/4 acre of wetland; (b) The permittee notifies the Environment Division in accordance with rules to be promulgated by the Environment Division; (c) The permittee has taken all practicable actions to minimize the on-site and off-site impacts of the discharge; (d) The discharge is part of a single and complete project; (e) This subsection applies only to single-family homes to be used for a personal residence; (f) Sufficient vegetated buffers must be maintained adjacent to all open water bodies, streams, etc., to preclude water quality degradation due to erosion and sedimentation. (h) For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"individual permittee\" refers to a natural person and/or a married or co-habitating couple, but does not include a corporation, partnership, or similar entity. Section 01-0303. Applications for Permits 1. Any person proposing to conduct or cause to be conducted a regulated activity upon any wetland shall file an application for a permit with the Environment Division. Review of the application shall be made by the Environment Division in accordance with applicable law and such rules as may be adopted by the Environment Division. The application shall include a detailed description of the proposed activity and a map showing the area of wetland directly affected, with the location of the proposed activity in relation to the wetland. 2. No sooner than thirty and not later than sixty days after receipt by the Environment Division of an application, and after notice of application has been published by the applicant either in a local newspaper, or by any means practicable, the Environment Division shall hold a public hearing on such application at a suitable location unless no notice of objection has been filed or unless the Environment Division finds the activity to be of such a minor nature as not to affect or endanger the balance of systems within the wetlands, in which case the Environment Division may, in the exercise of discretion, dispense with such hearing. At such hearing any person or persons filing a request for a hearing may appear and be heard. 3. The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the proposed activity will be in accord with the policies and provisions of this article . 4. Any person may ask the Environment Division whether or not a given parcel of land will be designated a wetland subject to regulation. The Environment Division shall give a definite answer in writing within 30 days of such request whether such parcel will or will not be so designated. The Environment Division shall make its determination based upon review of the Wetlands map, and a site visit. Applicants may, at their own risk and expense, commission a more precise delineation of the affected area. Such delineations are not binding upon the Environment Division and may only be performed by contractors approved by the Environment Division. 5. For permits whose issuance is reasonably calculated to affect wetlands that straddle Reservation boundaries, or over which jurisdiction is shared with some other governmental entity, the applicant shall forward copies of such application and proposed permit to the governmental entity affected by the issuance of such permit. The applicant shall provide notice to the Environment Division of such forwarding, and the Environment Division must allow at least 21 days for review and comment on such proposed permit prior to its issuance. \"Governmental Entity\" as used in this sub-part, refers solely and exclusively to the Governments of Akwesasne. Section 01-0304. Granting Permits 1. In granting, denying or limiting any permit, the Environment Division shall consider the effect of the proposed activity on Tribal health and welfare, fishing, flood and storm dangers, water quality and protection and enhancement of the wetlands and the benefits derived from wetlands as set forth in section 01-0102(5) of this article . 2. No permit shall be granted under this section unless the proposed activity is consistent with the land use regulations applicable, now, or in the future. 3. In granting a permit, the Environment Division may limit the permit or impose conditions designed to carry out the public policy set forth in this article . The Director of the Environment Division may issue citations, suspend, or revoke a permit if it finds that the applicant has not complied with any of the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the activity as set forth in the application. Environment Division suspension and revocation proceedings shall be governed by rules and regulations to be adopted by the Environment Division. 4. In the event that the Director of the Environment Division determines that a violation constitutes a serious, ongoing threat to Tribal health and safety, or to any Tribal member, the Director may request that the Tribal Council issue a cease and desist order to carry out the purposes of this Act . 5. The Environment Division shall state with a written record the findings and reasons for all actions taken under to this section . 6.
