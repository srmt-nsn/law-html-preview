                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/acts/MortgageForeclosureAndEvictionOrdinance#IA"><span id="IA"><span class="level-num">Section A. </span></span>Short Title</p>
                <p>This ordinance shall be known as the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Mortgage Foreclosure and Eviction Ordinance. Its short title shall be the "Foreclosure Ordinance".</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/acts/MortgageForeclosureAndEvictionOrdinance#IB"><span id="IB"><span class="level-num">Section B. </span></span>Findings</p>
                <p>The St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Council (the "Council") hereby finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="IB(1)">(1)</span> Due to the unique legal status of lands on the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation ("Reservation") it is difficult for members of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe ("Tribe") to purchase homes utilizing traditional financing methods.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="IB(2)">(2)</span> In order to alleviate this situation, which exists on all Indian reservations and lands, Federal Agencies such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") have established Indian housing loan guarantee programs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="IB(3)">(3)</span> In order for the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe and its members to participate in any mortgage loan programs, whether guaranteed or conventional, for either residential or commercial purposes it must first establish the required legal and administrative framework to protect the interests of borrowers, lenders, and federal agencies which guarantee or mortgage loans.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="IB(4)">(4)</span> One of the requirements for any mortgage loan program is to adopt adequate and clear foreclosure and eviction procedures to ensure a remedy for lenders in the event of a default.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/acts/MortgageForeclosureAndEvictionOrdinance#IC"><span id="IC"><span class="level-num">Section C. </span></span>Purpose</p>
                <p>The purpose of this ordinance is to provide recourse to lenders/mortgagees by providing for an orderly and fair method of foreclosing upon mortgages on assignments arising under the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Land Assignment Ordinance and to provide for an orderly and fair means of evicting those persons found to have committed unlawful detainer.</p>
                <h3 id="II">CHAPTER II DEFINITIONS</h3>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="II(13)">(13)</span> "Subordinate lien holder" is the holder of any lien, including a subsequent mortgage, perfected subsequent to the recording of a mortgage under this code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="II(14)">(14)</span> "Tribal Court" is the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Court as established by the laws of the Tribe or such body as may now or hereafter be authorized by the laws of the Tribe to exercise the powers and functions of a court of law.</p>
