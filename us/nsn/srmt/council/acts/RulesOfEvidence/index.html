                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="IVA.">A.</span> These Rules govern proceedings in the Tribal Court of the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="IVB.">B.</span> These Rules apply to civil actions and proceedings, to criminal cases and proceedings, to contempt proceedings and to juvenile proceedings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="IVC.">C.</span> These Rules do not apply to preliminary examinations in criminal cases; sentencing, or granting or revoking probation or parole; issuance of warrants for arrest; criminal summonses and search warrants; and proceedings covering release on bail.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="IVD.">D.</span> The Tribal Court may apply the interpretation of similar provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence in construing these rules. The Tribal Court shall look to the Federal Rules of Evidence for guidance on any matter not covered by these Rules.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/acts/RulesOfEvidence#V"><span id="V"><span class="level-num">Section V. </span></span>[Rule 2] Rulings on Evidence</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VA.">A.</span> Effect of Erroneous Ruling. Error may not be predicated on a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="VA.1.">1.</span> Objection. In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike is made and appears on the record, stating the specific ground for the objection, if such is not obvious from the context; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="VA.2.">2.</span> Offer of Proof. In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the Court by offer of proof or was apparent from the context within which the questions were asked.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VB.">B.</span> Record of Offer and Ruling. The Court may add any other or further statement which shows the character of the evidence, the form in which it was offered, the objection made, and the ruling. The Court may direct the making of an offer of proof in question and answer form.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VC.">C.</span> Hearing of the Jury. In jury cases, proceedings shall be conducted to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in the hearing of the jury.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VD.">D.</span> Plain Error. Nothing in this Rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the Court.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/acts/RulesOfEvidence#VI"><span id="VI"><span class="level-num">Section VI. </span></span>[Rule 3] Preliminary Questions</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VIA.">A.</span> Questions of Admissibility Generally. Preliminary questions concerning the qualifications of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the Court, subject to the provisions of subdivision of this Rule. In making its determination, the Court is not bound by the Rules of Evidence except those pertaining to privileges.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VIB.">B.</span> Relevancy Conditioned on Fact. When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the Court shall admit it subject to the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding that the condition of fact was fulfilled.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VIC.">C.</span> Hearing of the Jury. Hearings on the admissibility of confessions shall in all cases be conducted out of the hearing of the jury. Hearing on other preliminary matters shall be conducted when the interests of justice require, or when an accused is a witness and requests a hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VID.">D.</span> Testimony by Accused. The accused does not, by testifying upon a preliminary matter, become subject to cross-examination as to other issues in the case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VIE.">E.</span> Weight and Credibility. This Rule does not limit the right of a party to introduce before the jury evidence relevant to weight or credibility.</p>

                <p>When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the Court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VIIIA.">A.</span> "Relevant evidence" means evidence having a tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VIIIB.">B.</span> All evidence is generally admissible, except as otherwise provided by Ordinances, by acts of the Tribal Council, by these rules or other rules prescribed by the Court pursuant to statutory authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="VIIIC.">C.</span> Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.</p>

                <p>Evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury or it will cause undue delay, waste of time or be a needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="XA.">A.</span> Generally. Evidence of the character or character trait of a person is not admissible if it is to be used to prove conduct or for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="XB.">B.</span> Exceptions</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="XB.2.">2.</span> Evidence of a pertinent character trait of the victim, if offered by the accused, except in rape or assault with intention to commit rape cases, or if offered by the prosecution to rebut the same is admissible.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="XB.3.">3.</span> Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts only for the purpose of showing motive, intent, opportunity, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="XIA.">A.</span> Reputation or Opinion. In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of character of a person is admissible, proof may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into specific instances of conduct.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="XIB.">B.</span> Specific Instances of Conduct. In cases in which character or trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, proof may be made of specific instances of that person's conduct.</p>

                <p>Evidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of eye witnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice.</p>

                <p>If after an event measures are taken which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of the measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct, a defect in a product, a defect in a product's design, or a need for a warning or instruction in connection with the event. This Rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted or impeached.</p>
