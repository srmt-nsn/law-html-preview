                <p>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council ("Tribal Council") has provided in this Appendix the provisions for a qualified Tribal member or qualified Tribal business to apply for a license to brew beer as long as the brewery is connected to a licensed restaurant or bar.</p>
                <p>The rules set forth below shall govern the requirements for the licensing and reporting of any brewery.</p>
                <p>The Tribal Council hereby enacts the restrictions, regulations and provisions contained herein for the protection, health, welfare and safety of Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe ("Tribe").</p>

                <p>In order to safeguard the public's safety, the Tribal Council has deemed it necessary to regulate and control the sale and distribution of Alcoholic beverages within the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation ("Reservation") to promote temperance in consumption and respect for, and obedience to Tribal Law. It is hereby declared that such policy will best be carried out by empowering the Tribe's Compliance Department to determine whether the issuance of a License pursuant to this Appendix shall promote public convenience and advantage Tribal businesses and whether to increase or decrease the number of such Licenses. When considering a new License application, the Compliance Department also shall consider the proximity of each existing Licensed Premises to the proposed location. The denial of an application is subject only to the right of an Applicant to request the Compliance Department from reconsidering the denial based upon new information. If the Applicant is denied again then he/she can submit its request to Tribal Council for reconsideration.</p>
