                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/acts/PesticideRegulation#1.0"><span id="1.0"><span class="level-num">Section 1.0. </span></span>Purpose</p>
                <p>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (The "Tribe"), is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all community members. With respect to pesticide usage it has the authority, responsibility and jurisdiction to exercise sovereign rights in governing pesticide usage on the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation (Reservation). Through its Environment Division, the Tribe has determined that the management of pesticides through Tribal regulation will ensure the protection of Tribal member health by reducing unnecessary health risk exposures to pesticides.</p>
                <p>Further, the EPA's regulations under Environmental Protection Acts, Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 171 provide that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="1.01.">1.</span> An Indian tribe may develop its own plan for certifying private and commercial applicators to use or supervise the use of Restricted Use Pesticides (RUPS), subject to the approval of EPA;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="1.02.">2.</span> If a tribe does not develop its own certification plan, the tribe may choose to utilize a state's certification program, with the concurrence of that state, subject to the approval of EPA; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="1.03.">3.</span> EPA can implement a federal plan for the certification of applicators of RUPS where no other EPA-approved state or tribal applicator certification plan is in effect.</p>
                <p>The Tribe's strategy for regulating pesticide usage within its jurisdiction is to exercise option 3, relying upon EPA to certify RUP applicators. Additionally, the Tribe will exercise its sovereign right to regulate the use of General Use Pesticides (GUPS) within its jurisdiction through this regulation.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/acts/PesticideRegulation#2.0"><span id="2.0"><span class="level-num">Section 2.0. </span></span>Authority</p>
                <p>The authority of the Tribe to enact the Pesticide Regulation lies in the inherent sovereign authority of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe the Tribal Procedures Act section IV (C) (1), (2), (10) and (13) (TCR 2013-32); and the Tribal Court and Judiciary Code Section V and VI (TCR 2008- 22).</p>
                <p>Tribes cannot be granted primacy status under FIFRA. The EPA, however, does permit cooperative agreements to tribes who cooperate with EPA for the enforcement of FIFRA and who have developed their own Tribal Codes for pesticide use on tribal lands. If a tribal inspector uses tribal credentials for an inspection, enforcement can be pursued by the Tribal Council. If EPA credentials are used for an inspection, the Tribe shall send the inspection file and all information to the EPA's regional office.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/acts/PesticideRegulation#2.1"><span id="2.1"><span class="level-num">Section 2.1. </span></span>Federal Certification Rule</p>
                <p>Under the authority of Section 11(a)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, Rodenticide, Act (FIFRA), and in accordance with the regulations found at Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 171.11, the EPA is implementing a federal pesticide applicator certification plan (EPA plan) for those areas of Indian country where no other EPA-approved or EPA-implemented plan applies. This EPA plan describes a program for the certification of applicators of restricted use pesticides (RUPS) in Indian country based on the certification requirements enumerated at 40 CFR Part 171.</p>

                <p>Any violation of the Tribal Pesticide regulation may result in the revocation of an Applicator's permit, institution of fines and penalties as determined by a Tribal Compliance Office official, seizure of materials for evidence, and restitution for damages or losses that may have resulted from violations of this Ordinance. Additionally, the Tribe will advise EPA of any violations.</p>

                <p>Enforcement Policy: It is the policy of the Tribe to encourage informal, practical, result- oriented resolution of alleged violations and actions needed to prevent damage to Saint Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation resources or harm to the health, safety or welfare of the Reservation population. It is also the policy of the Tribe, consistent with the principles of due process, to provide effective procedures for enforcement.</p>
                <p>Enforcement Agency: The Tribe's Environment Compliance Officer ("Officer") shall be responsible for enforcing the provisions of this Code. Specifically, the Officer shall conduct investigations when a complaint is received by the Tribal Compliance Office, Environment Division or other Tribal agency believes that a violation of this Ordinance has occurred.</p>
                <p>Enforcement Activities: Where a verified complaint shall be filed with the Tribe and reviewed by the Environmental Compliance Officer alleging that, or where the Tribe itself shall have cause to believe that, any person is violating any pesticide regulation or permit condition, the Environmental Compliance Officer shall cause a prompt investigation to be made.</p>
                <p>Notice of Violation: Cease and Desist Order: If the Officer finds after an investigation pursuant to this Code that a violation of any regulation or permit condition exists, the Officer shall promptly notify both the alleged violator and the Tribal Council in writing. In the case of an apparent violation of this Ordinance, the Officer is authorized to issue a Notice of Violation to the person(s) apparently responsible for the violation, and, if the apparent violation occurred on property owned by a person other than the alleged violator, a Notice of Violation shall also be issued to the landowner.</p>
                <p>In the case of a continuing violation or a threatened violation, the Tribal Council shall issue a Cease and Desist Order to prevent the violation from continuing or occurring.</p>
                <p>Failure to comply with a Cease and Desist Order shall constitute a Second violation of this Ordinance. Both a Notice of Violation and a Cease and Desist Order may be issued for a single incident. A Notice of Violation will include a request to appear before the Officer at an enforcement hearing at a specified time and date, and shall advise the alleged violator that failure to appear may result in the imposition of civil penalties.</p>
                <p>If an Immediate Cease and Desist Order is issued without an accompanying Notice of Violation, the Order will inform the recipient that failure to comply with the Order will constitute a violation of this Ordinance, which will result in the issuance of a Notice of Violation that will indicate the alleged violations of this ordinance and may result in the imposition of civil penalties.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/acts/PesticideRegulation#7.2"><span id="7.2"><span class="level-num">Section 7.2. </span></span>Hearings on Violations</p>
                <p>Informal/Formal Hearings: The Officer shall afford the landowner or his or her representative reasonable opportunities to discuss proposed enforcement actions at an informal or formal hearing prior to taking further enforcement action, unless the Officer determines that there may be either imminent environmental damage to a Reservation resource or adverse impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the Reservation population. Informal or formal hearings may be used at any stage in the enforcement proceedings, except that the Officer may refuse to conduct informal or formal hearings with respect to any matter then pending before the Officer.</p>
                <p>Reports Required: The Officer shall keep written notes of the date and place of the hearing, the persons in attendance, the subject matter discussed and any decisions reached with respect to further enforcement action.</p>
                <p>Enforcement Hearings: If the landowner and the Officer are unable to resolve the matter via an informal or formal hearing, the Officer is authorized to conduct adjudicatory hearings to determine if a violation of this Code has occurred. In such a hearing the person so charged shall be entitled, at his or her own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other representative. The Officer shall rule that a violation of this Ordinance has occurred if it finds that the charges are supported by a preponderance of the credible evidence, which supports a finding that a violation occurred.</p>
                <p>Within thirty (30) days after the date of any enforcement hearing, the Officer shall issue a written decision. If the Officer determines that a violation has occurred and that the person(s) charged was (were) responsible for the violation, the Officer's decision shall include an Enforcement Order.</p>
                <p>Civil Penalties and Corrective Action: An Enforcement Order shall direct any person(s) found to have committed a violation of this Ordinance to take whatever corrective action the Officer deems appropriate under the circumstances. An Enforcement Order may impose civil penalties in accordance with a schedule of civil penalties prescribed under these rules. Alternatively, an Enforcement Order may impose civil penalties in the event that a person found to have committed a violation of this Code does not take corrective action in accordance with the Order within a prescribed time frame. If a person who has been found to have committed a violation does not take corrective action within the prescribed time frame, an appropriate department or agency of the Tribal government may take the necessary corrective action, in which case the amount of any civil penalty shall be increased by twice the amount of the cost incurred by the Tribal department or agency in taking the corrective action.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, if the Officer determines that noncompliance with this Ordinance is presenting an imminent and substantial threat to the public health, welfare or environment and determines, in consultation with the Tribe's attorneys, that it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the public health, welfare or environment of an administrative or judicial enforcement action under this part, the Officer may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect the public health, welfare or environment. Any such order shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall remain in effect for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days. Revocation of Permit. Failure of any person to comply with any Enforcement Orders shall result in an immediate revocation of his or her permit. In order to obtain a reinstatement of such permit, the person(s) against whom the Enforcement Order was issued must first demonstrate compliance with the Order and pay all outstanding penalties and then petition for reinstatement of the permit with the name of the particular Tribal Agency].</p>
                <p>Special Provisions for Tribal Departments and Agencies: In any case in which any Tribal agency or department is alleged to have violated the terms and conditions of a pesticide permit, or to have conducted activities without a permit, the Compliance Department shall bring the matter to the attention of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, Tribal Council who shall consider taking action to ensure compliance with this Ordinance. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the particular Tribal Agency shall conduct an enforcement hearing for the purpose of making factual determinations and issuing a decision recommending a course of corrective action if necessary.</p>

                <p>Once the Compliance Officer has issued a decision any person who is aggrieved by the decision has the right to appeal through the Tribal Appellate Court. This appeal must be filed in writing as a notice of appeal to the Tribal Appellate Court.</p>
                <p>Any person who is aggrieved by the issuance or denial of an applicator permit without respect to whether that person, corporation or other entity is a party to such permit application, or who is the subject of an Enforcement Order, may file an appeal with the Tribal Appellate Court.
