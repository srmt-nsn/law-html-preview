                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(2)">(2)</span> In a proceeding to modify a child custody determination, this court shall determine whether a proceeding to enforce the determination has been commenced in another state. If a proceeding to enforce a child custody determination has been commenced in another state, the court may:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(2)(A)">(A)</span> stay the proceeding for modification pending the entry of an order of a court of the other jurisdiction enforcing, staying, denying, or dismissing the proceeding for enforcement;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(2)(B)">(B)</span> enjoin the parties from continuing with the proceeding for enforcement; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(m)(1)">(1)</span> Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, this Court shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another jurisdiction to exercise jurisdiction.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(m)(2)">(2)</span> If this Court determines that it is an inconvenient forum, and that a court of another jurisdiction is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated jurisdiction and may impose any other condition the Court considers just and proper.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(n)">(n)</span> Duty to enforce.

This Court may utilize any remedy it has available to enforce a child custody determination made by a court of another jurisdiction.  If the Court believes a child(ren)'s health or safety is at imminent risk of danger it may request the assistance of the Tribe's Indian Child Welfare Act ("ICWA") program to take the necessary steps to ensure the child's safety and ICWA may request the assistance of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Police Department.</p>
