                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Antidegradation Policy:</p>
                <p>This antidegradation standard shall be applicable to any action or activity by any source, point or nonpoint, of pollutants that is anticipated to result in an increased loading of pollutants to Tribal surface waters. Pursuant to this standard:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Existing instream water uses, as defined herein, and the level of water quality necessary to protect existing uses shall be maintained and protected. Where designated uses of the water body are impaired, there shall be no lowering of the water quality with respect to the pollutant or pollutants which are causing the impairment;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Where, for any parameter, the quality of the waters exceed levels necessary to support the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the waters, that water shall be considered high quality for that parameter consistent with the definition of high quality water found at subsection of this antidegradation standard and that quality shall be maintained and protected unless the Tribe finds, after full satisfaction of Tribe's intergovernmental coordination and public participation provisions of the Tribe's continuing planning process, that allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation, the Tribe shall assure water quality adequate to fully protect existing uses. Further, the Tribe shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and existing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. The Tribe shall utilize the Antidegradation Implementation Procedures set forth below in determining if any lowering of water quality will be allowed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)(A)">(A)</span> The Tribe identifies waters for the protections described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section on a parameter-by-parameter basis.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Before allowing any lowering of high water quality, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Tribe shall find, after an analysis of alternatives, that such a lowering is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the area in which the waters are located. The analysis of alternatives shall evaluate a range of practicable alternatives that would prevent or lessen the degradation associated with the proposed activity. When the analysis of alternatives identifies one or more practicable alternatives, the Tribe shall only find that a lowering is necessary if one such alternative is selected for implementation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding national or tribal resource, such as waters of national and State parks and wildlife refuges and waters of exceptional recreational, religious or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> In those cases where the potential lowering of water quality is associated with a thermal discharge, the decision to allow such degradation shall be consistent with Section 316 of the Clean Water Act (CWA).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)(A)">(A)</span> As described in Section B. below, the Tribe has developed methods for implementing the antidegradation policy that are, at a minimum, consistent with the Tribe's policy and with paragraph (a) of this section. The Tribe shall provide an opportunity for public involvement during the development and any subsequent revisions of the implementation methods, and shall make the methods available to the public.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Antidegradation Implementation Procedures:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> Definitions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Control Document. Any authorization issued by a State, Tribal or Federal agency to any source of pollutants to waters under its jurisdiction that specifies conditions under which the source is allowed to operate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(B)">(B)</span> High quality waters. High quality waters are water bodies in which, on a parameter by parameter basis, the quality of the waters exceeds levels necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Outstanding Resource Waters. Those waters designated as such by the Tribe. The Waters that may be considered for designation as Outstanding Resource Waters include, but are not limited to, water bodies that are recognized as:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(C)(i)">(i)</span> Important because of protection through official action, such as Tribal, Federal or State law, Presidential or secretarial action, international treaty, or interstate compact;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(C)(ii)">(ii)</span> Having exceptional recreational significance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(C)(iii)">(iii)</span> Having exceptional ecological significance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(C)(iv)">(iv)</span> Having other special environmental, recreational, religious or ecological attributes; or waters whose designation as Outstanding Resource Waters is reasonably necessary for the protection of other waters so designated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(D)">(D)</span> Significant Lowering of Water Quality. A significant lowering of water quality occurs when there is a new or increased loading of any Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics (PBT) from any regulated existing or new facility, either point source or nonpoint source for which there is a control document or reviewable action, as a result of any activity including, but not limited to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(D)(i)">(i)</span> Construction of a new regulated facility or modification of an existing regulated facility such that a new or modified control document is required;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(D)(ii)">(ii)</span> Modification of an existing regulated facility operating under a current control document such that the production capacity of the facility is increased;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(D)(iii)">(iii)</span> Addition of a new source of untreated or pretreated effluent containing or expected to contain any PBT to an existing wastewater treatment works, whether public or private;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(D)(iv)">(iv)</span> A request for an increased limit in an applicable control document;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(D)(v)">(v)</span> Other deliberate activities that, based on the information available, could be reasonably expected to result in an increased loading of any pollutant to Tribal surface waters.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Notwithstanding the above, changes in loadings of any Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxic within the existing capacity and processes, and that are covered by the existing applicable control document, are not subject to an antidegradation review. These changes include, but are not limited to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Normal operational variability;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Changes in intake water pollutants;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(C)">(C)</span> Increasing the production hours of the facility, (e.g., adding a second shift); or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(D)">(D)</span> Increasing the rate of production.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Also, excluded from an antidegradation review are new effluent limits based on improved monitoring data or new water quality criteria or values that are not a result of changes in pollutant loading.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> For all waters, the Environment Division shall ensure that the level of water quality necessary to protect existing uses is maintained. In order to achieve this requirement, water quality standards use designations must include all existing uses. Controls shall be established as necessary on point and nonpoint sources of pollutants to ensure that the criteria applicable to the designated use are achieved in the water and that any designated use of a downstream water is protected. Where water quality does not support the designated uses of a water body or ambient pollutant concentrations exceed water quality criteria applicable to that water body, the Environment Division shall not allow a lowering of water quality for the pollutant or pollutants preventing the attainment of such uses or exceeding such criteria.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> For Outstanding Resource Waters:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)(A)">(A)</span> The Environment Division shall ensure, through the application of appropriate controls on pollutant sources, that water quality is maintained and protected.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)(B)">(B)</span> Exception. A short-term, temporary (i.e., weeks or months) lowering of water quality may be permitted by the Environment Division (or US EPA where SRMT is the permittee).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)(C)">(C)</span> For Natural State, high quality waters, the Environment Division shall ensure that no action resulting in a lowering of water quality occurs unless an antidegradation demonstration has been completed pursuant to Section C and the information thus provided is determined by the Environment Division pursuant to Section B of this Antidegradation Standard to adequately support the lowering of water quality.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(6)">(6)</span> The Environment Division or EPA shall establish conditions in the control document applicable to the regulated facility that prohibit the regulated facility from undertaking any deliberate action, such that there would be an increase in the rate of mass loading of any pollutant, unless an antidegradation demonstration is provided to the Environment Division and approved pursuant to Section D prior to commencement of the action. Imposition of limits due to improved monitoring data or new water quality criteria or values, or changes in loadings of any pollutant within the existing capacity and processes, and that are covered by the existing applicable control document, are not subject to an antidegradation review.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(7)">(7)</span> For PBTs known or believed to be present in a discharge, from a point or nonpoint source, a monitoring requirement shall be included in the control document. The control document shall also include a provision requiring the source to notify the Environment Division of any increased loadings. Upon notification, the Environment Division shall require actions as necessary to reduce or eliminate the increased loading.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)">(8)</span> Fact Sheets prepared for public review and comment shall reflect any conditions developed under this Antidegradation Standard and included in a permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(9)">(9)</span> Exemptions. Except as the Environment Division may determine on a case- by-case basis that the application of these procedures is required to adequately protect water quality, or as the affected water body is an Outstanding Resource Water as defined in Section B of this Antidegradation Standard, the procedures in this part do not apply to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(9)(A)">(A)</span> Short-term, temporary (i.e., weeks or months) lowering of water quality;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(9)(B)">(B)</span> Bypasses that are not prohibited at 40 CFR 122.41(m); and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(9)(C)">(C)</span> Response actions pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended, or similar Federal, State or Tribal authorities, undertaken to alleviate a release into the environment of hazardous substances or pollutants which may pose an imminent and substantial danger to public health or welfare.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Antidegradation Demonstration:</p>
                <p>Any entity seeking to lower water quality in a High Quality Water must first, as required by Section B of this Antidegradation Standard, submit an antidegradation demonstration for consideration by the Environment Division. The antidegradation demonstration shall include the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Pollution Prevention Alternatives Analysis. Identify any cost-effective pollution prevention alternatives and techniques that are available to the entity, that would eliminate or significantly reduce the extent to which the increased loading results in a lowering of water quality.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Alternative or Enhanced Treatment Analysis. Identify alternative or enhanced treatment techniques that are available to the entity that would eliminate the lowering of water quality and their costs relative to the cost of treatment necessary to achieve applicable effluent limitations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> Important Social or Economic Development Analysis. Identify the social or economic development and the benefits to the area in which the waters are located that will be foregone if the lowering of water quality is not allowed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> Special Provision for Remedial Actions. Entities proposing remedial actions pursuant to the CERCLA, as amended, corrective actions pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or similar actions pursuant to other Federal, State or Tribal environmental statutes may submit information to the Environment Division that demonstrates that the action utilizes the most cost effective pollution prevention and treatment techniques available, and minimizes the necessary lowering of water quality, in lieu of the information required by Section B of this Antidegradation Standard.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Antidegradation Decision:</p>
                <p>Once the Environment Division determines that the information provided by the entity proposing to increase loadings is administratively complete, the Environment Division shall use that information to determine whether or not the lowering of water quality is necessary, and, if it is necessary, whether or not the lowering of water quality will support important social and economic development in the area. If the proposed lowering of water quality is either not necessary, or will not support important social and economic development, the Environment Division shall deny the request to lower water quality. If the lowering of water quality is necessary, and will support important social and economic development, the Environment Division may allow all or part of the proposed lowering to occur as necessary to accommodate important social and economic development.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Mixing Zones:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> Where effluent is discharged into surface waters, a continuous zone shall be maintained in which the water is of adequate quality to allow the migration of aquatic life with no significant effect on their population. The cross-sectional zone area of wastewater mixing zones shall generally be less than 1/4 of the cross-sectional area or flow volume of the receiving river, stream or lake. Unmixed zones containing permitted effluent shall not be at locations of recreational or ceremonial use. (See Section V, below.) Water quality standards shall be maintained throughout Zones of Passage. Zones of passage in intermittent streams may be designated on a site specific basis. The water quality in a Zone of Passage shall not fall below standards for the designated water body(ies) within which the zone is contained.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> Mixing zones will not be granted for discharges to outstanding resource water, wetlands, or ephemeral or intermittent streams.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> Mixing zones will not be granted for Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics (PBT) consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 132. See appendix 1. Waste Load Applications (WLAs) in the absence of TMDLs, and WLAs for the purposes of determining the need for water quality based effluent limits (WQBELs) for new discharges of PBTs shall be set equal to the most stringent applicable criteria or values for the PBTs in question.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> Mixing zones shall not be used for, or considered as, a substitute for waste treatment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Allowance for Compliance Schedules</p>
                <p>NPDES permits, and other orders and directives of the Division issued under Tribal Council, for existing discharges or activities may include a schedule for achieving compliance with water quality criteria contained herein, consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR Parts 131.15 and 132. These compliance schedules shall be developed to ensure compliance with the water quality standards set forth in the shortest practicable time period, not to exceed five years. Decisions regarding whether to issue compliance schedules will be done on a case-by-case basis by the Tribal Council and approved by the Division, or the EPA where appropriate. These schedules will not be issued for new discharges or activities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Water Quality Standards Variances</p>
                <p>It is the SRMT's policy that a water quality standards variance is only appropriate when a designated use is not attainable in the short-term but might be attainable in the long-term. The SRMT may consider a temporary modification to a designated use and associated water quality criteria that would otherwise apply.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> Applicability: A variance from any WQS that is the basis of a water quality-based effluent limitation included in a Permit is based on the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)">(A)</span> A variance from WQS applies only to the permittee requesting the WQS variance, the water body/waterbody segment(s) specified in the WQS variance and only to the pollutant or pollutants specified in the WQS variance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(B)">(B)</span> A WQS variance does not affect, or require the SRMT to modify, in its standards, the underlying designated use and criterion address by the WQS variance, unless the SRMT adopts and EPA approves a revision to the underlying designated use and criterion consistent with §131.10 and §131.11. All other applicable standards not specifically addressed by the WQS variance remain applicable.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(C)">(C)</span> A variance does not affect, or require SRMT to modify, the corresponding water quality standard for the waterbody as a whole.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(D)">(D)</span> A WQS variance, once adopted by the SRMT and approved by EPA, shall be the applicable standard for purposes of the CWA under 40 CFR 131.21(d)-(e), for the following limited purposes. An approved WQS variance applies for the purposes of developing permit limits and requirements under 301(b)(1)(C), where appropriate, consistent with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The SRMT and other certifying entities may also use an approved WQS variance when issuing certifications under section 401 of the CWA.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(E)">(E)</span> A variance from a water quality standard shall not be granted that would likely jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species listed under Section 4 of the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) Act or result in the destruction or adverse modification of such species' critical habitat.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(F)">(F)</span> A variance from WQS shall not be granted if standards will be attained by implementing effluent limits required under sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA and by the permittee implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> The maximum timeframe: A variance from the WQS shall not exceed five (5) years or the term of the permit, whichever is less. The SRMT will review, and modify as necessary, variances from WQS as part of each water quality standards review pursuant to section 303(c) of the CWA.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)">(3)</span> Conditions to grant: A variance from the WQS may be granted if, and only if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(A)">(A)</span> The permittee demonstrates to the SRMT that attaining the WQS is not feasible because:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(A)(i)">(i)</span> Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the attainment of the WQS;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> Natural, ephemeral, intermittent or low flow conditions or water levels prevent the attainment of the WQS, unless these conditions may be compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent to enable WQS to be met without violating the SRMT's water conservation requirements;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(A)(iii)">(iii)</span> Human-caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the attainment of the WQS and cannot be remedied, or would cause more environmental damage to correct than to leave in place;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(A)(iv)">(iv)</span> Dams, diversions or other types of hydrologic modifications preclude the attainment of the WQS, and it is not feasible to restore the waterbody to its original condition or to operate such modification in a way that would result in the attainment of the WQS;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(A)(v)">(v)</span> Physical conditions related to the natural features of the waterbody, such as the lack of a proper substrate cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the like, unrelated to chemical water quality, preclude attainment of WQS; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(A)(vi)">(vi)</span> Controls more stringent than those required by sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(B)">(B)</span> The permittee shall also:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> The requirements that apply throughout the term of the WQS variance. The requirements shall represent the highest attainable condition of the water body or waterbody segment applicable throughout the term of the WQS variance based on the documentation required in (d)(2) of this section. The requirements shall not result in any lowering of the currently attained ambient water quality, unless a WQS variance is necessary for restoration activities, consistent with paragraph (d)(2)(A)(i)(b) of this section. DPNR must specify the highest attainable condition of the water body or waterbody segment as a quantifiable expression that is one of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(A)(ii)(I)">(I)</span> For discharger(s)-specific WQS variances:</p>

The term of the WQS variance must only be as long as necessary to achieve the highest attainable condition and consistent with the demonstration provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The SRMT may adopt a subsequent WQS variance consistent with this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(B)">(B)</span> The supporting documentation must include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(B)(i)">(i)</span> Documentation demonstrating the need for a WQS variance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(B)(i)(I)">(I)</span> For a WQS variance to a use specified in section 101(a)(2) of the CWA or a sub-category of such a use, the SRMT must demonstrate that attaining the designated use and criterion is not feasible throughout the term of the WQS variance because:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-6"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(B)(i)(I)(a)">(a)</span> All relevant information demonstrating that attaining the WQS is not feasible based on one or more of the conditions in §186-14 (c)(1) herein; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(B)(i)(II)">(II)</span> For a WQS variance to a non-101(a)(2) use, the SRMT must submit documentation justifying how its consideration of the use and value of the water for those uses listed in § 131.10(a) appropriately supports the WQS variance and term. A demonstration consistent with (d)(2)(A)(i) of this section may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(B)(ii)">(ii)</span> Documentation demonstrating that the term of the WQS variance is only as long as necessary to achieve the highest attainable condition. Such documentation must justify the term of the WQS variance by describing the pollutant control activities to achieve the highest attainable condition, including those activities identified through a Pollutant Minimization Program, which serve as milestones for the WQS variance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(B)(iii)">(iii)</span> In addition to (A) and (B) of this section, for a WQS variance that applies to a water body or waterbody segment:</p>
