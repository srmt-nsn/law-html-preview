A person who executes a certificate as an agent or fiduciary need not exhibit evidence of that person's authority as a prerequisite to filing.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Certify that the certificate of formation, the certificate of amendment, the certificate of correction, the certificate of amendment of a certificate with a future effective date or time, the certificate of termination of a certificate with a future effective date or time, the certificate of cancellation (or of any judicial decree of amendment or cancellation), the certificate of merger or consolidation, the restated certificate, the corrected certificate, the certificate of conversion to limited liability company, the certificate of transfer, the certificate of transfer and continuance, or the certificate of revival has been filed in the Secretary's office by endorsing upon the signed certificate the word "Filed" and the date and time of the filing. This endorsement is conclusive of the date and time of its filing in the absence of actual fraud. Except as provided in subdivision (a)(5) or (a)(6) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/16.05.180" title="16.05.180 Filing">this section</a>, such date and time of filing of a certificate shall be the date and time of delivery of the certificate;</p>

The Secretary is authorized to grant direct access to such system to registered agents subject to the execution of an operating agreement between the Secretary and such registered agent. Any registered agent granted such access shall demonstrate the existence of policies to ensure that information entered into the system accurately reflects the content of certificates in the possession of the registered agent at the time of entry.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> Upon request made upon or prior to delivery, the Secretary may, to the extent deemed practicable, establish as the date and time of filing of a certificate a date and time after its delivery. If the Secretary refuses to file any certificate due to an error, omission or other imperfection, the Secretary may hold such certificate in suspension, and in such event, upon delivery of a replacement certificate in proper form for filing and tender of the required fees within 5 business days after notice of such suspension is given to the filer, the Secretary shall establish as the date and time of filing of such certificate the date and time that would have been the date and time of filing of the rejected certificate had it been accepted for filing. The Secretary shall not issue a certificate of good standing with respect to any limited liability company with a certificate held in suspension pursuant to this subsection. The Secretary may establish as the date and time of filing of a certificate the date and time at which information from such certificate is entered pursuant to subdivision (a)(4) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/16.05.180" title="16.05.180 Filing">this section</a> if such certificate is delivered on the same date and within 4 hours after such information is entered.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)(C)">(C)</span> The Secretary determines that an extraordinary condition existed at such date and time, that such earlier effort was unsuccessful as a result of the existence of such extraordinary condition, and that such actual delivery and tender were made within a reasonable period (not to exceed 2 business days) after the cessation of such extraordinary condition, then the Secretary may establish such date and time as the date and time of filing of such certificate. No fee shall be paid to the Secretary for receiving an affidavit of extraordinary condition. For purposes of this subsection, an extraordinary condition means: any emergency resulting from an attack on, invasion or occupation by foreign military forces of, or disaster, catastrophe, war or other armed conflict, revolution or insurrection or rioting or civil commotion in, the United States or a locality in which the Secretary conducts its business or in which the good faith effort to deliver the certificate and tender the required fees is made, or the immediate threat of any of the foregoing; or any malfunction or outage of the electrical or telephone service to the Secretary's office, or weather or other condition in or about a locality in which the Secretary conducts its business, as a result of which the Secretary's office is not open for the purpose of the filing of certificates under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/16.05" title="Chapter 16.05 Limited Liability Companies">this chapter</a> or such filing cannot be effected without extraordinary effort. The Secretary may require such proof as it deems necessary to make the determination required under this subparagraph of subdivision (a)(6), and any such determination shall be conclusive in the absence of actual fraud. If the Secretary establishes the date and time of filing of a certificate pursuant to this subsection, the date and time of delivery of the affidavit of extraordinary condition or the date and time of the Secretary's written waiver of such affidavit shall be endorsed on such affidavit or waiver and such affidavit or waiver, so endorsed, shall be attached to the filed certificate to which it relates. Such filed certificate shall be effective as of the date and time established as the date and time of filing by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection, except as to those persons who are substantially and adversely affected by such establishment and, as to those persons, the certificate shall be effective from the date and time endorsed on the affidavit of extraordinary condition or written waiver attached thereto.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Upon the filing of a certificate of amendment (or judicial decree of amendment), certificate of correction, corrected certificate or restated certificate in the office of the Secretary, or upon the future effective date or time of a certificate of amendment (or judicial decree thereof) or restated certificate, as provided for therein, the certificate of formation shall be amended, corrected or restated as set forth therein. Upon the filing of a certificate of cancellation (or a judicial decree thereof), or a certificate of merger or consolidation which acts as a certificate of cancellation or a certificate of transfer, or upon the future effective date or time of a certificate of cancellation (or a judicial decree thereof) or of a certificate of merger or consolidation which acts as a certificate of cancellation or a certificate of transfer, the certificate of formation is cancelled. Upon the filing of a certificate of conversion to limited liability company or upon the future effective date or time of a certificate of conversion to limited liability company, the entity filing the certificate of conversion to limited liability company is converted to a limited liability company.
