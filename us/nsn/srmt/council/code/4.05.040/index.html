Such a license shall only be approved for those individuals who qualify and comply with the rules and regulations issued hereunder.</p>

If there is reason to believe that the applicant is not entitled to a license, the Compliance Director shall promptly notify the applicant of the contemplated disapproval and shall provide the applicant with an opportunity for a hearing with the Tribal Council.</p>
