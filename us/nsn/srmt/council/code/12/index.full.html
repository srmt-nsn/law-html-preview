The creditor shall state under oath that its claim is justly due, that to the extent payments were made by the deceased they have been credited, and that it knows of no offsets against the claim. If a creditor fails to present a claim within the time period allowed, the creditor may request Tribal Court in its discretion allow it to file the claim directly with the Tribal Court at the same time the Administrator presents the creditors' claims under subsection (4) below.

A Will or any part thereof may be revoked by a second (or later) valid Will, or a supplemental document (codicil) which has been signed and witnessed and is attached to a Will. In order for the prior Will to be revoked, the second Will (or later) or supplemental document must expressly state it is revoking a prior Will or the terms of the subsequent will or supplemental document are clearly inconsistent.

Unless the Will expressly states otherwise, any provision naming the former spouse as Executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian is also revoked.

To do so, the Executor shall search the deceased's records for bills, notices, loan papers, and other documentation that suggests the deceased may have outstanding debts. The Executor has the duty to contact all known creditors to determine amounts owed and the process for addressing bills and other debts. The Executor shall also publish a public notice within thirty (30) days of appointment stating that all other creditors must present their claims to the Executor and that only the claims presented may be considered for payment by the estate. The notice shall give the creditors thirty (30) days to respond and will clearly state the final date for claims to be presented. Unless there is a waiver or modification approved by the Court, the notice shall be posted on the Tribe's website, and published for three consecutive weeks in a publication of general distribution on the Reservation and if deemed necessary in the nearby towns of Massena and Malone.</p>

For those debts identified by the Executor from the estate records, the Executor shall prepare a list of the amounts owed and any necessary forms or documentation needed to resolve the debts and close accounts. Any other claims submitted by a creditor shall state under oath that his claim is justly due, that to the extent payments were made by the deceased they have been credited, and that he/she knows of no offsets against the claim. If a creditor fails to present a claim within the time period allowed, the creditor may request that the Tribal Court in its discretion allow him/her to file the claim directly with the Tribal Court at the same as the Executor presents the creditors' claims under subsection (4) below. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.</p>

An order regarding a creditor's claim may be appealed. If an objection or appeal is filed, the Administrator may pay creditors only after the Tribal Court issues an order regarding the validity of the claims. At no time, shall the Tribal Court permit the sale of Tribal Land to satisfy an estate's debts except if the claimant can show that the deceased expected his/her land to be sold to satisfy the outstanding debt.</p>
