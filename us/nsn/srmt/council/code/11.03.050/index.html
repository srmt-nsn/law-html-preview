                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> <u>Worksheet</u>. The Child Support Calculation Worksheet provided for in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/11.03" title="Chapter 11.03 Family Support Act">this chapter</a> will determine the proposed amount of child support a parent will be responsible for. The worksheet will be completed utilizing the following steps:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(A)">(A)</span> <u>Determine Total Gross Annual Income of each parent</u>. Total Gross Income is determined by totaling all funds received from any source before taxes or other expenses of any kind are taken out. Total Gross Annual Income does not include public assistance payments or child support received or paid on behalf of children of other relationships</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(B)">(B)</span> <u>Determine Total Annual Deductions of each parent</u>. Total Annual Deductions is determined by totaling all deductions from income which include federal, state, and local taxes, state unemployment and disability taxes, and social security taxes, union dues but it does not include deductions such as voluntary retirement contributions and transportation deductions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(C)">(C)</span> <u>Calculate Annual Net Income of each parent</u>. Annual net income is calculated by subtracting the total annual deductions (b) above from the total gross annual income (a) above.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(D)">(D)</span> <u>Calculate Combined Annual Net Income</u>. Combined Annual Net income is determined by totaling the annual net income of the Custodial Parent's (CP) and Non-Custodial Parent's (NCP) annual net incomes with the maximum outlined in the CSSC of the Combined Annual Net Income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(E)">(E)</span> <u>Determine the Basic Child Support Obligation</u>. To determine the Basic Child Support Obligation, multiply the Combined Annual Net Income by the appropriate child support percentage listed in the CSSC.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(F)">(F)</span> <u>Determine Proportional Share of Combined Annual Net Income</u>. To determine each parent's proportional share of combined annual net income in order to calculate their proportional share of the basic child support obligation, divide each parent's annual net income by the total combined annual net income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(G)">(G)</span> <u>Calculate Basic Child Support Obligation without consideration of low-income limitations</u>. To calculate each parent's Basic Child Support Obligation without considering low income limitation, multiply the basic child support obligation by each parent's proportional share of combined annual net income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(H)">(H)</span> <u>Determine Low Income Limitations</u>. Low income limitations are determined by utilizing the current Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and the Self-Support Reserve (SSR) as reported by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. These limitations are calculated by subtracting each parent's basic child support obligation from their annual net income and then comparing the result with the current FPL and SSR. If the amount falls between the FPL and the SSR, then the presumptive amount will be $25.00 per month ($300.00 annually). If the amount falls below the FPL, then the presumptive amount will be $0.00. If the amount is greater than the SSR, then the low-income limitations do not affect the obligation and the presumptive amount will be the Child Support Obligation as calculated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(I)">(I)</span> <u>Determine Social Security Offset</u>. If a child is receiving Social Security cash benefits as a result of the parent's disability, the amount owed for child support shall be reduced by the amount of the child's monthly cash benefit. Should the child's monthly cash benefit exceed the amount of the monthly child support obligation there shall be no credit against any child support arrears.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> <u>Medical Costs</u>. Medical support may be considered if one or both parents have accessible and affordable health coverage available for the child at a reasonable cost. Reasonable cost is defined as being no more than 5% of a parent's gross income. If a child is eligible for Indian Health Service, the Tribal Court will not establish a medical support order. However, the Tribal Court may require parents to share in the child care expenses and/or extraordinary medical expenses not covered under any policy, plan, or Indian Health Service (IHS).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> <u>Non-Cash Support</u>. Non-cash support may be considered by the Tribal Court in lieu of cash child support only when agreed upon by both parties.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(4)">(4)</span> <u>Deviation</u>. There is a rebuttable presumption that the worksheet calculations are correct to support the requested award of child support. However, the Tribal Court has discretion to deviate from the child support calculation based on substantial evidence that the calculation would be harmful to the parent. If the Court decides to deviate from the calculations, the Court shall state in a written order the amount that would have been ordered had the guidelines been followed and the Court must justify such deviation.

If the employer fails to withhold income in accordance with the terms contained in the Notice of Income Withholding, the employer may be held liable for all amounts that should have been withheld from the payor. The SRMT-CSEU has the authority and standing as the Tribal agency with authority to enforce this Tribe's interest in child support, to initiate an action to recoup such amounts.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> <strong>Enforcement of Child Support Orders</strong></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)">(1)</span> Should a payor fail to pay his or her support pursuant to the Tribal Court Order, SRMT- CSEU may report the delinquency to credit bureaus and pursue any other enforcement action available under applicable law.</p>
