                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The following terms and phrases used in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/15.01" title="Chapter 15.01 Tribe Hemp Production Regulations">this chapter</a> are arranged in alphabetical order. More detailed definitions of some technical terms are contained in the USDA Final Rule, Subchapter A which is adopted and incorporated by reference in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/15.01" title="Chapter 15.01 Tribe Hemp Production Regulations">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> "Acceptable hemp THC level" is when the application of the measurement of uncertainty to the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis produces a distribution or range that includes 0.3% or less. For example, if the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis is 0.35% and the measurement of uncertainty is +/- 0.06%, the measured delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis for this sample ranges from 0.29% to 0.41%. Because 0.3% is within the distribution or range, the sample is within the acceptable hemp THC level for plan compliance. This definition of "acceptable hemp THC level" affects neither the statutory definition of hemp, 7 U.S.C. § 1639o (1), in the 2018 Farm Bill nor the definition of "marihuana," 21 U.S.C. § 802(16), in the CSA.</p>

For purposes of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/15.01" title="Chapter 15.01 Tribe Hemp Production Regulations">this chapter</a>, a conviction is expunged when the conviction is removed from the individual's criminal history record and there are no legal disabilities or restrictions associated with the expunged conviction, other than the fact that the conviction may be used for sentencing purposes for subsequent convictions. In addition, where an individual is allowed to withdraw an original plea of guilty or nolo contendere and enter a plea of not guilty and the case is subsequently dismissed, the individual is no longer considered to have a conviction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> "Corrective action plan" means a plan established by the Tribe for a licensed hemp producer to correct a negligent violation or non-compliance.</p>

The decarboxylated value is also calculated using a conversion formula that sums delta-9-THC and eighty-seven and seven tenths (87.7) percent of THC-acid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(9)">(9)</span> "Decarboxylation" means the removal or elimination of carboxyl group from a molecule or organic compound.</p>

HPLC relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material to separate and analyze compounds.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(20)">(20)</span> "Key participants" means a sole proprietor, a partner in partnership, or a person with executive managerial control in a corporation. A person with executive managerial control includes persons such as a chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. This definition does not include non-executive managers such as farm, field, or shift managers.</p>

The term 'marihuana' does not include hemp, as defined in section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 and does not include the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination (7 U.S.C. 1639o). "Marihuana" means all cannabis that tests as having a concentration level of THC on a dry weight basis of higher than 0.3 percent.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(26)">(26)</span> "Post decarboxylation" means a value determined after the process of decarboxylation that determines the total potential delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content derived from the sum of the THC and THC-A content and reported on a dry weight basis. The post decarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The post decarboxylation value of THC can also be calculated by using a high-performance liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THC-A intact, and requires a conversion calculation of that THC-A to calculate total potential THC in a given sample.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(27)">(27)</span> "Produce" means to grow hemp plants for market, or for cultivation for market, in the United States.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(32)">(32)</span> "Total THC" is the value determined after the process of decarboxylation, or the application of a conversion factor if the testing methodology does not include decarboxylation, that expresses the potential total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content derived from the sum of the THC and THCA content and reported on a dry weight basis. This post-decarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, such as gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The total THC can also be calculated by using a liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THCA intact. This technique requires the use of the following conversion: [Total THC = (0.877 x THCA) + THC] which calculates the potential total THC in a given sample.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(33)">(33)</span> "Tribal Member" or "Mohawk Tribal Member" means a person who is enrolled in the Tribe under the Tribe's Membership Code or a person who is eligible to be enrolled regardless of where they reside.</p>
