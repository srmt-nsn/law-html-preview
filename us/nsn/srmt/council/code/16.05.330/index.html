If the limited liability company refuses to permit a member to obtain or a manager to examine the information described in subsection (a)(3) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/16.05.330" title="16.05.330 Access to and Confidentiality of Information; Records">this section</a> or does not reply to the demand that has been made within 5 business days after the demand has been made, the demanding member or manager may apply to the Tribal Court for an order to compel such disclosure. The Tribal Court is hereby vested with exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether or not the person seeking such information is entitled to the information sought. The Tribal Court may summarily order the limited liability company to permit the demanding member to obtain or manager to examine the information described in subsection (a)(3) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/16.05.330" title="16.05.330 Access to and Confidentiality of Information; Records">this section</a> and to make copies or abstracts therefrom, or the Tribal Court may summarily order the limited liability company to furnish to the demanding member or manager the information described in subsection (a)(3) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/16.05.330" title="16.05.330 Access to and Confidentiality of Information; Records">this section</a> on the condition that the demanding member or manager first pay to the limited liability company the reasonable cost of obtaining and furnishing such information and on such other conditions as the Tribal Court deems appropriate.

The Tribal Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the obtaining or examining of information, or award such other or further relief as the Tribal Court may deem just and proper. The Tribal Court may order books, documents and records, pertinent extracts therefrom, or duly authenticated copies thereof, to be brought within the Reservation and kept within the Reservation upon such terms and conditions as the order may prescribe.</p>
