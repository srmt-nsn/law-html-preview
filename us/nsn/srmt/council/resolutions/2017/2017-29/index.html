                <p>WHEREAS, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council (the "Tribal Council") is the duly recognized governing body of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (the "Tribe") and is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all community members; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Tribal Council has been authorized to act on the Tribe's behalf to protect the natural resources and the environment through enactment of laws, ordinances and regulations, and program development through its Environment Division; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, it is the policy of the Tribe to maintain a reasonable degree of purity of Tribal Air Resources that is consistent with the public health and welfare and public enjoyment thereof, the industrial development of the Reservation, the propagation and protection of flora and fauna, and the protection of physical property and other resources, and to that end to require the use of all available methods to prevent and control air pollution; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Tribe desires to accomplish this policy through the adoption of tribal laws, rules and regulations under its Tribal Implementation Plan ("TIP") wherein the Tribe has been delegated primary authority under the Clean Air Act ("CAA") to be treated in the same manner as a State under the CAA; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Tribe's TIP includes standards for polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") adopted by Tribal Council Resolution ("TCR") 1989-19 (Appendix C of the TIP) that are designated "ambient levels" and "clean-up standards" for soils, lands, vegetation, air, sediment, surface waters or ground waters of the Reservation; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, EPA's Revised Interim Final Guidance on Indian Involvement in the Superfund Program, OSWER Directive 9375.5-02A (Nov. 28, 1989), provides for recognition of Tribal laws and regulations as Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements ("ARARs"); and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the PCB standards set forth in TCR 1989-19 were recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as ARARs for purposes of remediation of the General Motors Massena Superfund Site; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, TCR 1989-19 established an ambient air standard for PCBs of background or 5 ng/m<sup>3</sup>; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, PCBs are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as known human carcinogens; are documented to cause a reduction in IQ, shorter attention span and ADHD-like symptoms; reduce thyroid function, increasing risk of hypothyroidism; interfere with sex honnones; and increase risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, scientific health studies conducted on the Reservation have shown PCB exposure among Tribal members to be correlated with reduced memory function in adolescents and adults; reduced thyroid function in adolescents and adults; altered growth and development in children and adolescents; increases in obesity; increased production of serum cholesterol and triglycerides, which are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease; and rates of type 2 diabetes; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, a major route of exposure to PCBs for persons residing on the Reservation is inhalation of vapor-phase PCB congeners; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, over the past twenty-seven (27) years since adoption of these standards, the Tribe has learned through studies and research, most recently through a Report prepared by Dr. David O. Carpenter, "Scientific Support Summary for Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Air Quality Standards for PCBs" (a copy of which is attached to this TCR) that the Tribe's members have been exposed to potentially significant levels of PCBs for many years through a variety of exposure pathways; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, there is a need to adopt updated ambient air standards for PCBs on the Reservation to take into account information developed since 1989 concerning the adverse human health effects of PCBs, the documented adverse human health effects on Tribal members correlated with past and ongoing PCB exposure on the Reservation, and the identification of inhalation as a major route of potential exposure to PCBs for Tribal members;</p>
                <p>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council hereby amends the Ambient Air Standards on the Saint Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation, as attached; and</p>
                <p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the ambient air quality standards for PCBs set forth in this TCR are in addition to and supplement the PCB air quality standard in Appendix C (TCR 1989-19) to the Tribal Implementation Plan and that standard remains in full force and effect; and</p>
                <p>BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, this Tribal Council Resolution hereby supersedes <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2017/2017-24" title="Resolution No. 2017-24 — Resolution of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe to Adopt Updated Ambient Air Standards on the Saint Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation">TCR 2017-24</a>.</p>
