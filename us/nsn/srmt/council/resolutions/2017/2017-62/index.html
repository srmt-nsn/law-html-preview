                <p>WHEREAS, in TCR 2008-22, the Tribal Council repealed the Act and enacted the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court and Judiciary Code in its place; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, in TCR 2012-13, the Tribal Council amended the Saint Regis Tribal Court and Judiciary Code; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Tribal Council now wishes to further amend the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court and Judiciary Code to rename the Peacemakers Court, Civil Traffic Division to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court, Traffic Court Division and amend the qualifications for Traffic Court Judges.</p>
                <p>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council hereby amends the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court and Judiciary Code Section V.3 with the following language: <em>"The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court, Traffic Court Division shall have original jurisdiction over any violation of the "Act Relating to the Regulation of Vehicle and Traffic On and Through the Saint Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation," as enacted in TCR 2000-109, and any amendments thereto;"</em> and</p>
                <p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council hereby amends the first paragraph of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court and Judiciary Code Section VIII with the following language: <em>"Tribal judges shall be elected pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/1.03" title="Chapter 1.03 Election and Referendum Ordinance">Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe's Election and Referendum Ordinance</a>, as amended, for three (3) year terms.
