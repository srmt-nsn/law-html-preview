                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/11.1">1.1</span> <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
                <p>It is the tradition of the Mohawk People to look generations forward in planning. It is with this foresight that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Solid Waste Management Code ("Code") is intended.</p>
                <p>Solid waste disposal practices need to be maintained in good harmony with Mother Earth since these practices will have an effect on the future generations inheriting this land. Adherence to <code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2020-09">this Code</code-cite> will ensure that best practices for solid waste management are maintained.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/11.2">1.2</span> <strong>AUTHORITY</strong></p>
                <p>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe ("Tribe" or "SRMT") has the inherent authority to manage and regulate the storage, collection, transportation, handling, treatment and disposal of solid waste in a manner which best protects Mother Earth, her natural resources, and the health, welfare, and economic security of this generation of Mohawk People and the generations to follow.</p>
                <p>The Tribe retains the inherent sovereign power to exercise civil authority and jurisdiction over the conduct of both Tribal and non-Tribal members on all lands within the Saint Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation ("Reservation"). These civil actions will be taken when necessary to maintain the environment, natural resources, public health, safety, welfare, political integrity and economic security of the Tribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/11.3">1.3</span> <strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>
                <p><code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2020-09">This Code</code-cite> does not allow for the improper disposal of any Solid Waste on the Reservation. Improper disposal or creating an Open Dump of any Solid Waste materials or recyclables, whether on the side of the road, in the Community Recycling Depot, or anywhere that they should not be disposed of, will be considered a violation of the Code. Disposal of such Solid Waste or creating an Open Dump site is different than someone who litters as outlined in the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Traffic Code <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/code/3.01.030#(e)(6)" title="">Section III(5)(f)</a> (<a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2018/2018-09" title="Resolution No. 2018-09 — To Amend the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Traffic Law">TCR 2018-09</a> or as amended).</p>
                <p>It is the intent of <code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2020-09">this Code</code-cite> to create a comprehensive integrated waste management policy that requires all solid waste to be disposed of properly at management facilities on and off the Reservation. <code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2020-09">This Code</code-cite> encourages Mohawk People to reduce, recycle and reuse those materials that do not belong in the waste stream. Education of the community through diverse media has been a continuing process, aimed at eliminating the poor solid waste disposal practices of the past.</p>
                <p>The Code intends to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/11.3(1)">(1)</span> Protect the health and safety of Tribal members and all other persons within the Reservation;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/11.3(3)">(3)</span> Protect the historical and cultural values and traditions of the Tribe, Mohawk land as a permanent Tribal homeland, and maintain its aboriginal character;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/11.3(4)">(4)</span> Prevent solid waste pollution, including contamination of the Tribe's groundwater, surface waters, drinking water supplies, and all other natural resources;</p>

All Solid Waste passing through the Transfer Station must be ultimately treated or disposed of at a facility authorized by the Environment Division if it is located within the Reservation, or by the appropriate governmental agency or agencies if in other states, territories, or nations. In the case of transfer stations at which Solid Waste is intended to be placed on vessels, no Solid Waste shall be placed on a vessel not owned or operated by a City whose population exceeds one million, without having first received written approval from the Environment Division. That approval shall be granted if the operator of the facility submits to the Environment Division the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>a certified copy of each permit or other authorization pertaining to the operation of the treatment or disposal facility to which the Solid Waste will be brought, issued by each governmental entity having jurisdiction over that facility; and,</li>
                  <li>original letters from each jurisdiction through which that Solid Waste will pass, and from each jurisdiction in which that Solid Waste will be treated or disposed of, stating that the governmental entity does not object to the Solid Waste being transported through or treated or disposed of within its jurisdiction.</li>

                <p>As a condition for the issuance of a Solid Waste collection and transportation permit, the Tribe's Compliance Department shall require every vehicle operated by the Hauler to be conspicuously marked to identify it. Every vehicle shall be marked with the trade name of the Hauler, and the number of the transportation permit issued pursuant to this Section. Every vehicle and driver must be licensed and must comply with all safety and insurance requirements of the state or province from which he/she is licensed.</p>
                <p>After placement of Solid Wastes and recyclable materials at the roadside or other designated area approved by the Tribe for collection, such Solid Wastes and recyclable material shall be delivered to the SRMT Transfer Station located at 179 County Route 43, Fort Covington NY. In certain situations, the Hauler may be granted permission to <strong>by-pass</strong> the SRMT Transfer Station and deliver Solid Waste directly to the Franklin County Landfill. The Hauler must first provide enough historical data to establish a monthly average tonnage of Solid Waste being transported from the Reservation to the landfill. The Hauler will be charged a "Regional Fee". Regional Fees and "Transfer Station Price List" can be found on the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe's webpage (https://www.srmt-nsn.gov/).</p>
                <p>As a condition for the issuance of a Solid Waste collection and transportation permit, a Hauler agrees to make an annual report by December 1 of each year, to the Tribe's Compliance Department, indicating the number and type of installations emptied or cleaned, the quantity of Solid Wastes disposed of, the place and manner in which such Solid Wastes were finally disposed, quantity and types of recyclables collected, and such other information as the Compliance Department may require. A renewal application may be denied by the Compliance Department for failure of the Permittee or Hauler to properly and timely file an annual report.</p>
                <p>The Compliance Department on a calendar basis must renew solid waste permits for the collection and transportation annually. The Environment Division shall adopt rules and regulations for Solid Waste collection and transportation on the Reservation in consultation with the Compliance Department, including the operation of management facilities, and may impose whatever conditions it deems reasonably necessary to protect the environment, and the health, safety and welfare of the Tribe and its members before issuing any permit under this Section.</p>
