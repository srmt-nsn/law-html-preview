                <p>The purpose of these informal Rules of Evidence is to ensure that the Tribal Court is able to determine the truth of a matter with a minimum of delay, confusion, and uncertainty of the parties.</p>

For example, in oral testimony, the testimony of persons who testify from their personal knowledge, such as first-hand observation of, or participation in, the event described shall be given more weight than the testimony of persons who only have knowledge of the event that they gained from other persons.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/XXIB.2.(a)">(a)</span> State the issue which he or she will use the evidence to resolve; and</p>
