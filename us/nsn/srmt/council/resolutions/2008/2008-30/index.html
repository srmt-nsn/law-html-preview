                <p><code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2008-30">This ordinance</code-cite> shall be known as the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Land Assignment Ordinance. Its short title shall be the "Land Assignment Ordinance".</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2008/2008-30#attachments/law/I/B"><span id="attachments/law/I/B"><span class="level-num">Section B. </span></span>Findings</p>
                <p>The St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Council ("Council" or "Tribal Council") hereby finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/I/B(1)">(1)</span> Due to the unique legal status of lands on the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation ("Reservation"), it is difficult for members of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe ("Tribe") to purchase homes utilizing traditional financing methods.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/I/B(2)">(2)</span> In order to alleviate this situation, which exists on all Indian reservations and lands, federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") have established Indian housing loan guarantee programs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/I/B(3)">(3)</span> In order for the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe and its members to participate in any mortgage loan program, whether guaranteed or conventional for either residential or commercial purposes, it must first establish the required legal and administrative framework to allow for Reservation land parcels to be used as a security interest for mortgages.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/I/B(4)">(4)</span> Currently, individual tribal member land interests on the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation are held pursuant to a tribal member's Deed of Right to Use and Occupancy that is approved by the Tribal Council and filed with the Tribal Clerk's office.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2008/2008-30#attachments/law/I/C"><span id="attachments/law/I/C"><span class="level-num">Section C. </span></span>Purpose</p>
                <p>The purpose of <code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2008-30">this ordinance</code-cite> is to convert and structure the current land interests into tribal land assignments so that such may be pledged as security for a mortgage; and to create a land assignment process to protect the interests of the tribal member borrower, the lender, and any federal agency that is involved.</p>
                <h3 id="attachments/law/II">CHAPTER II DEFINITIONS</h3>
                <p>In construing the provisions of this Land Assignment Ordinance, the following words or phrases shall have the meanings designated unless a different meaning is expressly provided, or the context clearly indicates otherwise:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/II(2)">(2)</span> "Assignment" means the real property located on the Reservation to which assignment rights are made appurtenant and vested in an assignee pursuant to this Land Assignment Ordinance expressly including the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/II(2)a.">a.</span> any tract of land described in, or delineated on a survey as suitable for the construction of a dwelling or building; and</p>
