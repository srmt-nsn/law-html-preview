                <p>WHEREAS, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council (the "Tribal" Council") is the duly recognized governing body of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (the "Tribe") and is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all community members; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Tribal Council is responsible for the general welfare of the membership, water, lands and real properties within the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, by TCR 2021-33 the Tribal Council adopted the original "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Adult Use Cannabis Ordinance" ("AUC Ordinance") establishing rules and regulations governing commercial use and activity of "Adult Use Cannabis" including but not limited to cultivation, processing and sale on tribal territory; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, by TCR 2022-17 the Tribal Council amended the AUC Ordinance to permit drive through sales windows at licensed retail stores and to increase the number of plants permitted under a Tier Ill cultivation license; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Tribe's regulatory agencies for cannabis, the Cannabis Control Board ("CCB") and the Cannabis Compliance Office ("CCO") have recommend certain additional amendments to the AUC Ordinance related to: (1) providing waivers to licensing of applicants who have been operating with Tribal cannabis licenses; and (2) allowing licensing of so-called "consumption lounges" under strict conditions.</p>
                <p>NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT, that the Tribal Council hereby adopts the "Second Amended Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Adult Use Cannabis Ordinance" a copy of which is attached to this Resolution that includes the following amendments:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Amend Chapter Three, Sections 3.01 And 3.05 to add AUC consumption lounge licenses to list of available licenses and allow waivers to license applicants who have been operating with Tribal cannabis licenses;</li>
                  <li>Amend Chapter Four adding Section 4.05 including Lounge application requirements;</li>
                  <li>Amend Chapter Six to add licensing fees for consumption lounge licenses;</li>
                  <li>Amend Chapter Seven to provide an exception for consumption at retail location if there is a licensed consumption area; and</li>
                  <li>Add a new Chapter Eight to include specific rules that apply to consumption lounge operations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Attached hereto is a copy of the amended AUC Ordinance containing all of these changes.</p>

                <p>This Ordinance shall be known as the "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Adult Use Cannabis Ordinance".</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2023/2023-05#attachments/law/1/1.02"><span id="attachments/law/1/1.02"><span class="level-num">Section 1.02. </span></span>Purpose</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.02(a)">(a)</span> This Ordinance establishes rules and regulations governing commercial use and activity of "Adult Use Cannabis" (recreational or non-medical cannabis) (hereinafter "AUC" or "Cannabis") including, but not limited to, cultivation, processing and sale on tribal territory. No persons shall engage in any commercial AUC activities unless licensed under this Ordinance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.02(b)">(b)</span> This Ordinance allows adult, tribal members to grow and possess a limited number of Cannabis plants for their own, non-commercial, personal use at their own residences on tribal territory.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.02(c)">(c)</span> This Ordinance consolidates Tribal regulation of all cannabis activities including but not limited to hemp, medical cannabis and AUC, within one Tribal board, the Tribal Cannabis Control Board ("CCB"), and one Tribal regulatory office, the Cannabis Compliance Office ("CCO").</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.02(d)">(d)</span> This Ordinance includes appropriate fees on commercial AUC activities to fund tribal oversight and regulation and to fund tribal member programs and services.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2023/2023-05#attachments/law/1/1.03"><span id="attachments/law/1/1.03"><span class="level-num">Section 1.03. </span></span>Authority</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.03(a)">(a)</span> The Tribe's authority to adopt this Ordinance is based upon the Tribal Procedures Act, as amended, and the Tribe's inherent sovereign power to: (1) enact laws governing commercial activity within its territory; and (2) adopt regulations to protect the health, safety and general welfare of tribal members.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2023/2023-05#attachments/law/1/1.04"><span id="attachments/law/1/1.04"><span class="level-num">Section 1.04. </span></span>Federal Guidance</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.04(a)">(a)</span> The U.S. Department of Justice has previously issued guidance and policy regarding the use and sale of cannabis by tribes on their territory. The guidance and policy advises tribes to include in their cannabis programs provisions to prevent the distribution of cannabis to minors; prevent the diversion and trafficking of cannabis, especially to criminal elements such as gangs and cartels; and prevent drugged driving and other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.04(b)">(b)</span> This Ordinance provides a robust regulatory system that addresses these issues. It requires use of a tracking system to record cannabis transactions on tribal territory from cultivation to sale. It contains mandatory rules on sales to minors. And it includes provisions protecting community health and safety at least as robust as those imposed by New York State with respect to AUC sales.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2023/2023-05#attachments/law/1/1.05"><span id="attachments/law/1/1.05"><span class="level-num">Section 1.05. </span></span>Other Laws Unaffected</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.05(a)">(a)</span> Nothing in this Ordinance is intended to allow driving under the influence of cannabis or driving while impaired by cannabis or to prevent enforcement of any laws imposing penalties for driving under the influence or while impaired.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.05(b)">(b)</span> Nothing in this Ordinance is intended to limit any privileges or rights of a medical marijuana patient, primary caregiver or registered or licensed entity under the Tribe's Medical Marijuana Ordinance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.05(c)">(c)</span> Nothing in this Ordinance shall affect the ability of any employer on tribal territory to enact policies restricting the use of cannabis by employees.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1/1.05(d)">(d)</span> All existing authority of the Tribe shall remain in full force and effect, and nothing in this Ordinance repeals or limits the Tribe's authority to impose penalties or initiate punitive proceedings before or after its effective date.</p>
