                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawXII.A.">A.</span> Only a pledgor or a pledgor's authorized representative is entitled to redeem the pledged goods described in the pawnbroker transaction form. If the pawnbroker determines that the person is not the original pledgor and is not otherwise authorized, the pawnbroker is not required to allow the redemption. The person redeeming must sign the pledgor's copy of the pawnbroker transaction form, which the pawnbroker may retain as evidence of the person's receipt of the pledged goods. A pledgor's representative must present written authorization from the original pledgor and the pawnbroker shall record the person's name and address on the pawnbroker transaction form. It is the responsibility of the pawnbroker to verify that the person redeeming pledged goods is authorized to do so.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawXII.B.">B.</span> If a pledgor's copy of the form is lost, destroyed or stolen, the pledgor must notify the pawnbroker in a written statement. The pawnbroker must record on this written statement the date and the number of the pawnbroker transaction form lost, stolen or destroyed. A photocopy of the person's picture identification must be attached and the statement must be signed by the pawnbroker or employee who accepts the statement from the pledgor. A fee of no more than $2.00 may be charged for each lost, stolen or destroyed pawnbroker transaction form.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawXII.C.">C.</span> If pledged goods are lost or damaged while in possession of the pawnbroker, the pawnbroker must fully compensate pledgor or replace the lost or damaged goods with that of equal value. Such replacement is a defense to any civil action based upon loss or damage of the pledged goods.</p>
