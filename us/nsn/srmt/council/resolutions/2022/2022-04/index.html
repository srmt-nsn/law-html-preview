                <p>WHEREAS, in TCR 2000-12, the Tribe authorized the Environment Division to obtain delegation of the Clean Water Act, now known as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), programs to the Tribe from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and determined that the Tribe's Environment Division shall have primary responsibility for establishing, reviewing, implementing and revising water quality standards under the FWPCA, Section 303, and for issuing certifications under Section 401, subject to Tribal Council's review and approval in accordance with Tribal law; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on October 16, 2002 the EPA approved the Tribe's Treatment in the Similar Manner as a State (TAS) Application to administer programs under the FWPCA; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, in accordance with the FWPCA, Section 303 and 401, the Environment Division's Water Resources Program is responsible for implementing water quality standards and issuing certifications; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, in TCR 2016-67, the Tribal Council adopted Water Quality Standards ("WQS") and in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2020/2020-02" title="Resolution No. 2020-02 — Amend Tribal Water Quality Standards under the Authority of the Clean Water Act">TCR 2020-02</a> the Tribal Council re-certified the WQS for the Tribe; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, in accordance with the FWPCA, Section 303(c)(1) the Water Resources Program is required, at least once every three years, to review applicable water quality standards and, as appropriate, modify and adopt standards; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Environment Division Water Resource Program recommends an amendment to the WQS that includes updated definitions to class A, class B, and to class C type waterbodies, including changes to class descriptions, and changes to substance standards to more accurately reflect the current contaminant concentration calculation standards. Substances with changes or newly added are as follows:</p>

                <p>The Tribal Council of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, a federally - recognized Tribe of Indians, hereby enacts the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Water Quality Standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/IA.">A.</span> <u>Purpose</u>.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the Tribe's Water Quality Standards is as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/IA.1.">1.</span> Assign designated uses for which Tribal Surface Waters shall be protected;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/IA.2.">2.</span> Prescribe and impose water quality standards (narrative and numeric) in order to sustain the designated use of Tribal Surface Waters;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/IA.3.">3.</span> Protect against the degradation of Tribal Surface Waters;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/IA.4.">4.</span> Promote the social welfare and economic well-being of the Tribe;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/IA.5.">5.</span> Promote a holistic watershed approach to management of the Tribal Surface Waters;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/IA.6.">6.</span> Provide for the protection of threatened or endangered species and,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/IA.7.">7.</span> Protect cultural and ceremonial uses.</p>
                <p>The purpose of these water quality standards is to facilitate sovereign self-determination and the restoration and preservation of traditional hunting, fishing, gathering and cultural uses in, on and around Tribal Surface Waters. The Environment Division is committed to providing cleaner, safer water for all of creation. These water quality standards will in turn promote the general welfare and well-being of the community by allowing the Tribe and its members to utilize the water for traditional, cultural and ceremonial purposes. Water quality standards are not used to control, and are not invalidated by, natural background phenomena or acts of the Creator.</p>
                <p>These purposes shall be accomplished by utilizing the standards set forth in the Tribe's Water Quality Standards as the basis for permitting and management process for point source discharges and nonpoint source generators, by using treatment technologies to control point sources and by adopting best management practices for nonpoint sources of pollution.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/IB.">B.</span> <u>Authority</u>.</p>
                <p>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe maintains the plenary sovereign power to regulate the quality of Tribal Surface Waters in the interest of the health and wellbeing of the Mohawk People. Pursuant to §§303 and 518 of the Clean Water Act the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved the Tribe's Application for a Determination of Eligibility to Administer Programs under the Clean Water Act on October 16, 2002.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/IC.">C.</span> <u>Applicability</u>.</p>
                <p>The Tribal Water Quality Standards apply to all Tribal Surface Waters, that is, all surface waters within the exterior boundaries of the Saint Regis Mohawk Territory, including water situated wholly or partly within, or bordering upon, the Territory, whether public or private, except for private waters that do not combine with other surface waters.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/ID.">D.</span> <u>Implementation</u>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/ID.1.">1.</span> Water Resources Personnel. The Water Resources Program shall administer the SRMT WQS. The program is comprised of a Program Manager and Technicians. This program shall serve under the direction of the Director of the SRMT Environment Division.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/ID.2.">2.</span> Consistency. The Tribe's Water Quality Standards are consistent with section 101(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251(a)(2)), which declares that "it is the national goal that, wherever attainable, an interim goal of water quality which provides for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and provides for recreation in and on the water achieved by July, 1983...." Primary contact and ceremonial use, agricultural and water supply use are other designated uses of Tribal Surface Waters. The Tribe's Water Quality Standards provide that such designated uses shall not result in any contamination that may lower the quality of the water below what is required for recreation and protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/ID.3.">3.</span> Antidegradation Policy. The antidegradation policy for Tribal Surface Waters and the procedures for implementing it are set forth in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2022/2022-04#attachments/law/III" title="III Antidegradation Policy And Implementation Procedures, Mixing Zones, And Allowance For Compliance Schedules">Section III</a> and in the Implementation Plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/ID.4.">4.</span> Revisions. The Tribal Water Quality Standards will be reviewed every 3 years. The review provides an opportunity for revisions and/or additions based on new information or for clarification of existing issues.</p>

Following enactment, pursuant to Section 303(c)(1) of the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. Section 303(c)], the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe shall hold public hearings at least once every three years for the purpose of reviewing and, as appropriate, amending the Tribal Water Quality Standards. Findings and revisions shall incorporate relevant scientific and engineering advances as well as any other relevant environmental concerns.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/ID.6.">6.</span> Protection of Designated Uses. Conditions particular to a use shall be protected at all times. General Conditions (<a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/srmt/council/resolutions/2022/2022-04#attachments/law/IV" title="IV General Conditions">Section IV</a>, below) shall be maintained at all times and shall apply to all Tribal Surface Waters, whether perennial, ephemeral, or intermittent. The standards assigned to each Tribal Surface Water shall be the most stringent standards required to protect all uses designated for that body of water.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/ID.7.">7.</span> Use Attainability. In the event that monitoring of water quality identifies reaches where attainable water quality is less than what is required by the Tribal Water Quality Standards, then the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe may modify the Water Quality Standards to reflect attainability. Modification shall then be within the sole discretion of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, but shall be subject to the provisions of the Clean Water Act, and shall be carried out in accordance with use-attainability analysis procedures required by 40 CFR 131.10. A designated use, that is not an existing use, may be removed if it is demonstrated that attaining the designated use is infeasible. Further, at a minimum, uses are considered attainable if they can be achieved by implementing effluent limits required under Sections 301(b) and 306 of the Clean Water Act (Act) and by implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management practices (BMPs) for nonpoint source control. (40 CFR 131.10(h)(2)). If the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe adopts a new or revised water quality standard based on a required use attainability analysis, the Tribe shall also adopt the highest attainable use, as defined in §131.3(m).</p>
                <p>A Use Attainability Analysis must be conducted whenever: (1) The Tribe designates or has designated uses that do not include the uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act, or (2) The Tribe wishes to remove a designated use that is specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act or to adopt subcategories of uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act which require less stringent criteria. The regulation (at 40 CFR 131.10(g)) specifies that States and Tribes may remove a designated use which is not an existing use if attainment of a use is not feasible due to the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/ID.7.a.">a.</span> Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the attainment of a use; or,</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/ID.7.e.">e.</span> Physical conditions related to the natural features of the water body, such as the lack of a proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the like, unrelated to water quality, preclude attainment of aquatic life protection uses; or, f. Controls more stringent than those required by Sections 301(b) and 306 of the Act would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact.</p>

                <p>* It is estimated that during times of peak flow the Raquette River mixes with the St Lawrence at the point of intake for the SRMT drinking water treatment plant and provides a maximum contribution of approximately 15% to the SRMT drinking water intake. Under normal flow conditions it is estimated that this contribution is reduced to between 0% and 2% of daily intake.</p>
                <p>** Subsistence fish consumption has been an <strong>ongoing practice</strong>; however, the current WQ does not does not support this use for all individuals. Women of child bearing age and children are advised to restrict consumption to certain species and reduced quantities (fewer than 8, 4 oz. portions per month). SRMT currently defines subsistence fishing as consuming locally caught fish at a daily average rate of 150g/dy or 40 portions per month.</p>
