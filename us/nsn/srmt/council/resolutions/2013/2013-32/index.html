                <p>WHEREAS, The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council (the "Tribal Council") is the duly recognized governing body of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (the "Tribe") and is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all community members; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, In Tribal Council Act 94-D, the Tribal Council adopted the Act Relating to Tribal Council Powers, Procedures, Initiative Referendum, Recall and Removal from Office, commonly referred to as the 1994 Procedures Act, on August 23, 1994, to enact provisions of law that establish the general powers of the Tribal Council, define Tribal Council procedure and provide for initiative, referendum, and removal of appointed or elected officials from office under certain circumstances; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, The Governance Committee, in conjunction with Tribal Council and its Legal Department, recommended that amendments be made to the 1994 Procedures Act to give enrolled Tribal Members a greater voice in Tribal Government and making the Tribal Government more transparent and accountable to Tribal Members; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, The amended document would significantly change the governance of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe such that Tribal Council deemed it necessary to seek the community's advice and consent through a referendum prior to any amendments being adopted; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on June 1, 2013, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council held a referendum which asked the following question: "Do You Support the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Council Adopting the Tribal Procedures Act?" and Tribal Members voted overwhelmingly in favor of adopting the Tribal Procedures Act with 648 in favor and 274 votes opposed; now, therefore, be it</p>
                <p>RESOLVED, That the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council hereby adopts the Tribal Procedures Act, as attached hereto, which will supersede and replace the Tribal Council Act 94-D: Act Relating to Tribal Council Powers, Procedures, Initiative Referendum, Recall and Removal from Office, commonly referred to as the 1994 Procedures Act, and directs that all administrative steps necessary to implement the provisions of the Tribal Procedures Act be taken in accordance with its terms.</p>

The Ordinance allows more Member participation in the Tribal Government, makes it much less burdensome for Members to initiate petitions to enact laws, reject laws and place questions before the membership in a referendum process. The Ordinance also makes the Tribal Council's (hereafter referred to as Council) actions more transparent and open by requiring the Council to conduct its business through regular meetings open to the membership. In addition, the Ordinance establishes rules or conduct and procedures for Tribal Monthly Meetings, provides for a process allowing Members to review Tribal budgets and also allows Members access to public Tribal records.</p>
