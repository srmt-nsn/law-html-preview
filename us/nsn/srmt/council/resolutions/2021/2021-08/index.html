                <p><code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2021-08">These regulations</code-cite> shall be known and cited as the "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Hemp Production Regulations".</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawII.">II.</span> <strong>PURPOSE, AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION</strong></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawII.A.">A.</span> The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council ("Tribal Council") adopts these Hemp Production Regulations ("Regulations") to establish rules to govern the production of hemp on Mohawk Tribal Territory.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawII.B.">B.</span> Authority to adopt <code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2021-08">these Regulations</code-cite> derives from the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe's ("Tribe") inherent sovereignty to regulate activities within Mohawk Tribal Territory that includes the authority to regulate hemp production and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-334, December 20, 2018, 132 Stat. 4490 ("Farm Bill") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ("USDA") Final Rule (January 19, 2021), 86 FR 5596, recognizing a tribe's right to assume primary authority over hemp production.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawII.C.">C.</span> The Tribe's jurisdiction, as recognized in the USDA Final Rule, upon approval by USDA, extends to production of hemp with the Tribe's territory regardless of the extent of the Tribe's inherent regulatory authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawIII.">III.</span> <strong>DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawIII.A.">A.</span> The following terms and phrases used in <code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2021-08">these Regulations</code-cite> are arranged in alphabetical order. More detailed definitions of some technical terms are contained in the USDA Final Rule, Subchapter A which is adopted and incorporated by reference in <code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2021-08">these Regulations</code-cite>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawIII.A.1.">1.</span> "Acceptable hemp THC level" is when the application of the measurement of uncertainty to the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis produces a distribution or range that includes 0.3% or less. For example, if the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis is 0.35% and the measurement of uncertainty is +/- 0.06%, the measured delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis for this sample ranges from 0.29% to 0.41%. Because 0.3% is within the distribution or range, the sample is within the acceptable hemp THC level for plan compliance. This definition of "acceptable hemp THC level" affects neither the statutory definition of hemp, 7 U.S.C. § 1639o (1), in the 2018 Farm Bill nor the definition of "marihuana," 21 U.S.C. § 802(16), in the CSA.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawIII.A.3.">3.</span> "Cannabis" means a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae of which <em>Cannabissativais</em> a species, and <em>Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis</em> are subspecies thereof. Cannabis refers to any form of the plant in which the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration on a dry weight basis has not yet been determined.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawIII.A.4.">4.</span> "Conviction" means any plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or any finding of guilt, except when the finding of guilt is subsequently overturned on appeal, pardoned, or expunged. For purposes of <code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2021-08">these Regulations</code-cite>, a conviction is expunged when the conviction is removed from the individual's criminal history record and there are no legal disabilities or restrictions associated with the expunged conviction, other than the fact that the conviction may be used for sentencing purposes for subsequent convictions. In addition, where an individual is allowed to withdraw an original plea of guilty or nolo contendere and enter a plea of not guilty and the case is subsequently dismissed, the individual is no longer considered to have a conviction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawIII.A.5.">5.</span> "Corrective action plan" means a plan established by the Tribe for a licensed hemp producer to correct a negligent violation or non-compliance.</p>

The decarboxylated value is also calculated using a conversion formula that sums delta-9-THC and eighty-seven and seven tenths (87.7) percent of THC-acid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawIII.A.9.">9.</span> "Decarboxylation" means the removal or elimination of carboxyl group from a molecule or organic compound.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawIII.A.10.">10.</span> "Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol" or "THC" is the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. For the purposes of this part, delta-9 THC and THC are interchangeable.</p>

A basis for expressing the percentage of a chemical in a substance after removing the moisture from the substance. Percentage of THC on a dry weight basis means the percentage of THC, by weight, in a cannabis item (plant, extract, or other derivative), after excluding moisture from the item.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawIII.A.14.">14.</span> "Entity" means a corporation, joint stock company, association, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, irrevocable trust, estate, charitable organization, or other similar organization, including any such organization participating in the hemp production as a partner in a general partnership, a participant in a joint venture, or a participant in a similar organization.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/lawIII.A.19.">19.</span> "High-performance liquid chromatography" or "HPLC" is a type of chromatography technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. HPLC relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material to separate and analyze compounds.</p>

The post decarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The post decarboxylation value of THC can also be calculated by using a high-performance liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THC-A intact, and requires a conversion calculation of that THC-A to calculate total potential THC in a given sample.</p>

This post-decarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, such as gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The total THC can also be calculated by using a liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THCA intact.
